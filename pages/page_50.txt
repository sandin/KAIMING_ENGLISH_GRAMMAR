In fact, it is often easier and more idiomatic to say It requires a lot of money to build a fine house than to say To build a fine house requires a lot of money. Thus we get three ways of expressing the action as a n.

A. Talking is easier than acting.
B. To talk is easier than to act.
C. It is easier to talk than to act.
