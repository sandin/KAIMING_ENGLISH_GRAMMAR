The Relative Clause

9.60. The Relative Clause.—The relative clause does not exist in the Chinese language, but is one of the most characteristic constructions of English and its allied languages. A relative clause is a clause introduced by a relative pron. or relative adv. The essence of a relative pron. or adv. is that, while it serves its usual grammatical function in the clause, it acts at the same time as a conjunction to connect the clause with some preceding word, called its “antecedent.”
