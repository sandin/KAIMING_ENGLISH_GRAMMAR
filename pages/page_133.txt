Singular and Plural

5.20. The Plural Endings -s and -es.—In English, we distinguish between singular (one thing) and plural (more than one). As remarked above, mass-words and abstract nn. have no number but only quantity, and so are not included here in the study of number. Most English nn. now have come to use the ending -s as a sign of the plural number. We may call these plurals in -s (or -es) regular plurals, while other plurals not so formed may be called irregular plurals.

This -s ending is normally or usually pronounced as [z]. Only after p, t, k do we have the pronunciation [-ps, -ts, -ks], because p, t, k have no voice but only breath, and it is unnatural to put in voice again with a [z]. After the sounds [s, z, ʃ, ʒ, tʃ, dʒ], we say [iz] and spell the ending with -es, because it is difficult to pronounce s-z, ch-z, j-z, etc. together. Practise pronouncing the following words correctly:—
