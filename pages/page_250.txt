MODIFICATION

words they modify and these are principally phrases and
clauses. These are the Infinitive Phrase, the Participial
Phrase, the Prepositional Phrase, and the Relative Clause and
their modifications. Finally, we shall go on to study the
Predicate Modifiers, which are generally words again, and
not phrases or clauses. This will conclude our study of
the important function of modification.

The Infinitive Phrase as Modifier

9.31. The Infinitive Phrase as Modifier.—The infinitive
is one of the commonest forms used in English. We have
already seen it used as a noun phrase in § 2.30. Here we
shall study its function as a modifier. The main types
are five:—

(a) Something to do, a book to read (as adj.).
(b) Came to tell you, began to see (to complete the meaning of
some preceding vb.).
(c) Brave enough to go, too poor to pay (to complete the mean-
ing of some preceding adj.).
(d) To be sure, to tell you the truth (as an independent or
absolute phrase in a sentence).
(e) Ask him to come, allow him to stay (modifying the object).

The types “b” and “e” are strictly both predicate modi-
fiers, but for the sake of convenience, “b” will be studied
here first, while “e” will come under §9.70.

Examples for study and practice follow:—

(a) These include the English equivalents of Chinese
phrases like 有事可做, 無書可讀, 有人做伴, 有功課要預備,
etc.
