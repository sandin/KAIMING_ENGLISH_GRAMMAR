SENTENCE MOODS

Of course in wish to and I hope to, both words are
followed by the infinitive.

The English way of thinking makes a sharp distinc-
tion between what is a fact and what is a mere wish or
desire. In case of a wish, we always use the vb. in the
infinitive, even when a past form or an added -s is usually
required. Thus, we have He commanded that the witness tell
(not told) everything he knew before the court, and Our wish
was that he leave (not left) this city at once. So also we have
God save the king! (not saves), and Long live the Republic!
(not lives). Another common English way of expressing
a wish is to use may in such sentences as May God bless
you! and May you live to repent this! A wish for what has
not happened is often expressed by an exclamation with
if: If I only had more money! / If I could only see her face
once more! / If I only knew!

3.74. Permission, Prohibition, Obligation, etc.—The
English expression of allowing (permission) and not
allowing (prohibition) is rather simple and similar to
Chinese. Both may and can are used to express permis-
sion and prohibition, but where the idea of allowed to, not
allowed to is strictly meant, we should use may and not
can.

May (Can) I go out, sir?
May (Can) I go now?
