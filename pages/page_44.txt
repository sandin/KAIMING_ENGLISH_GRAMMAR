In English, the class of words called prepositions are
bound up in idea with the nn. following them, very much
as transitive verbs are bound up in idea with their objects.

I fear him.                      I am afraid of him.
Fight them.                      Fight against them.

We should read of him as one word, dropping the
accent entirely in him, just as in fear him. Chinese
students often read him, them too clearly. In grammar,
we say the first him and them are objects of verbs, and the
second him and them are objects of prepositions. We say
the prepositions “govern” their objects, just as transitive
verbs govern their objects also. If what follows the
preposition is a verb or an adjective, it is at once turned
into a noun, as “without saying good-bye,” “before leav-
ing,” “by his kindness.”
