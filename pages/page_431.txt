CHAPTER XVI
ECONOMY OF EXPRESSION

16.10. Ease and Economy.—Proficiency in any language means a certain ease in handling its sentence forms and constructions. The foreign student is apt to err on the side of stiffness and over-correctness of expression. He says, for instance, “you must not” instead of “you mustn’t,” and “if it is possible” instead of “if possible.” These simpler forms, however, are used to a very large extent by the native speakers, for every language has naturally evolved certain omissions and short cuts which make for ease and economy. The English language, in particular, is marked by its love of economy and simplicity of construction, for the Englishman does not use more words than is strictly necessary for his purpose. It is therefore very appropriate that we should conclude our study of English grammar with a review of its various word-saving and energy-saving devices.

Shifting of Function

16.20. Shifting of Function.—A n. generally makes for simpler and shorter sentences than other parts of speech. Compare the following sentences:—

I saw hatred in his eyes. Or: His eyes seemed to show hatred.
His eyes seem to show that he hated me.

I have no fear of his running away.
I am not afraid that he may run away.
