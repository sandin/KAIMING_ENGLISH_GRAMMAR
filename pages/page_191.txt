METAPHORS AND FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS 169

Metaphors, therefore, greatly increase the expressiveness of one’s language. Sometimes, metaphors are used for elegant variation, as in calling a miser not a miser, but a Jew, or again, through further variation, a gentleman from Palestine. But usually, metaphors are used on their own merits—the merits of expressiveness. To call a wicked woman a she-devil is direct and to the point, and to call a man somebody’s under-dog is more forceful than to say he is somebody’s subservient servant. If a man is talking nonsense, it is easier to shut him up by calling it perfect rot than describing it as nonsensical talk. When a rich bourgeois merchant died with lots of money, it may be more appropriate to say that he cut up fat. The concrete imagery of a fat pig being cut up for the enjoyment of his relatives suggests many things which abstract terminology cannot. To tell the soldiers that they are cannon-fodder may have more persuasive force than volumes of prize essays on international peace. (Cf. the imagery in Chinese 組上魚肉, 釜底游魂, 甕中鱉.) Further examples are:—

A misplaced eyebrow: contemptuously of a small moustache.
A salamander: one who loves to sit by the fire.
A chatterbox: a woman given to chattering.
A dumb bell: (Amer. slang) one who does not understand, a fool.
Take a moral holiday: have a spree or indulge in temporary immorality.
Take rosy-coloured views: be optimistic.
The seamy side of life: the unseen and less beautiful side.
Make sheep’s eyes at lady: cast amorous glances.
An eyesore: person or thing one hates to see, e.g., dirty hut near a mansion, a poor relative, etc.
An eyewash: (slang) humbug, something made to deceive.
A bed of roses: easy and luxurious life.
