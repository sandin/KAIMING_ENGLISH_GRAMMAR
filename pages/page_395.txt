THE SUBJECTIVE MOOD

between fact and fancy in the speakers of the English
language, a distinction which is not observed in Chinese.
14.12. Subjective and Objective Moods.—From a no-
tional point of view, we may divide the verbal moods into
two classes: subjective (主觀) and objective (客觀). He
came, for instance, is a bald statement of an objective fact;
He might come / He would come / if he should come are state-
ments of subjective judgments. In That is a mistake, the
vb. is is definitely used to state a fact (although it may
involve a subjective judgment), but in That must be a
mistake / That would be a mistake / That might be a mistake,
the vbb. must be, would be and might be state only subjective
opinions.
The “subjective moods” may also be called “potential
moods” (see §§ 3.71-3.77). They cover a wider field than
the old term “subjunctive mood.” For instance, in I hope
you will come, will come is really a subjective statement (a
hope) although in form it is said to be in the indicative,
and not the subjunctive, mood.

The Subjunctive Mood

14.20. The Subjunctive Mood: Shifting of Tense.—It is
necessary to study the forms of the subjunctive mood
first. We have the following forms:—
(1) If I had known. (Past)
(2) If I knew. (Present)
(3) If I don’t come home tonight. (Future)
(4) If I (should) know. (General)

In addition, we have to examine the subjunctive forms of
the vb. to be (if he be / if he were / if he was).
