say “I stood and waited,” but it would be better English to say “I stood waiting there”; if it is intended to describe the standing as a condition, one should say, “I waited there, standing (in the rain).” The most common uses of the participial phrase are to describe a manner, a cause or motive, and to indicate general relationships.

(1) Describing manner.—

Shouting at the top of his voice, he said to them . . . .
The child returned home, stretching both his hands to his mamma, and dropping his satchel.
The old man came, mumbling something in an undertone.

(2) Describing cause or motive.—The words think, believe, mistake, hear, etc., when used as participles, usually describe a state of mind, and therefore help to indicate or explain the motive of action.—

Seeing that there was no more hope, the parents sat quietly in despair.
Thinking that Chinese medicine might help, they sent for an old Chinese doctor.
Believing what the Chinese doctor said, they had high hopes again.
