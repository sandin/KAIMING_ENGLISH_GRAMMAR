CONFLICT OF CASE
159

Sometimes this is confused by the introduction of an
independent clause, like I think, they suppose, but the rule
remains unchanged. Compare the following:—

Then came Mr. Dobson, who (not whom) we knew was a grocer.
We knew he (not him) was a grocer.
Then came Mr. Dobson, whom they knew to be a grocer. They
knew him to be a grocer.
He met the girl whom he recognized to be his childhood friend.
He recognized her (not she) to be his childhood friend.
News came from Captain Johnson, who, they had thought, was
dead. He, they had thought, was dead.
News came from Captain Johnson, whom they had regarded as
dead. They had regarded him as dead.

Notice also the following:—

I don’t know (who did it).
We will decide (who is to go first).

The whole who-clauses are the objects of know and decide,
and therefore we do not say whom. Again, the use of who
or whom depends on the relation inside the clause.

(3) Whoever : whomever. Like who and whom, the
use of whoever or whomever also depends on its relation
inside the clause entirely. “Whoever” simply means
“any person who” and “whomever” means “any person
whom.”

Whoever says so is a liar or a knave. (Any person who says so, etc.)
Whoever comes is welcome. (Any one who comes, etc.)
Whomever they met was asked to contribute a few dollars. (Any
person whom they met, etc.)
I will marry whoever comes first my way. (I will marry any one
who comes, etc.)
They stopped whomsoever they saw. (They stopped any person
whom they saw.)
