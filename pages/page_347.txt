PUNCTUAL AND DURATIVE VBS. 325

while the vb. to do best represents the punctual vbb. When
a man is lazy or dishonest, he is lazy or dishonest even in
his sleep. On the other hand, a man may steal something
today and yet not steal anything tomorrow. Very often
we dislike a person not for what he does, but for what
he is. Some typical examples of punctual vbb. worth
noticing are given below:—

That reminds me I have still two letters to write.
It occurred to me we might send Miss Ch— along.
He went to bed and fell asleep. (The proper way to say 睡覺了
in English is to use is asleep, is sleeping or has fallen asleep.)
I came to the conclusion that . . . (Seldom I concluded.)

The practical consequences of this distinction between
punctual and durative vbb. are four. (1) In order to
express durative actions with punctual vbb., we have to
use any of the durative tenses (perfect, continuous, per-
fect continuous). Thus come is a punctual vb., but we can
express an extended action with it by saying, for instance,
I’ve come to know him. Stop is also a punctual vb., but we
can say I have never stopped loving you, which refers to a
long period.

(2) In order to express punctual actions with durative
vbb., we have to use helping phrases like came to, began to.
Thus know is a durative vb., while the act of beginning to
know (punctual) may be expressed by such phrases as
came to know, learnt to know, began to know.

(3) Many durative vbb. like know, understand, think,
believe, regard, consider, value, despise, hate, love, fear are in
themselves sufficient to indicate their durative nature.
These words generally do not require the continuous tense
