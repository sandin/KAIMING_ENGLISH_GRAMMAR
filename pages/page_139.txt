5.24. Psychological Intent: Three Weeks Is Heaps of Time.—When we say “Five dollars is too dear,” or “Ten minutes is enough,” or “Three years is too long for an engagement,” we are really using a “collective” meaning, so the vb. in the singular is quite right, and English commonsense has triumphed over grammatical nonsense. Similarly, we can say:—

Three weeks is heaps of time.
Another three days was wasted.
Every five minutes he dropped in once.
Take any three of them.
Before three days was passed, the landlord came again.
Take that three dollars and buy yourself a new straw hat.
Their honeymoon lasted only seventeen days. But that wonderful two weeks and half (or: two-weeks-and-half) was the happiest time of her life.

In the expression “mother and child” (母女倆兒) the conception is really “collective” although we seldom use a singular vb. with it. Similarly, we have the following:—

They are a second Romeo and Juliet (pair of sweethearts).
He is a second (Dr.) Jekyll and (Mr.) Hyde (double personality).
