TIME OF ACTION

yard / The Japanese eat a lot of beans and fish / Bread is made from flour / If you take the plug off, the current is cut off / There is not enough ventilation in this room. For this reason, we see that the simple present in English is used to express habitual actions like know and love that cover a long time, and eternal truths or general statements. But it is never used to express really present action. When a man is killing a boy unintentionally, say to him, “You are killing the boy!” and not “You kill the boy!” although the killing may take only a fraction of a second. (See §11.10.)

Future

13.30. Expression of Future.—Future action differs from present action in that it has not yet actually taken place, and hence the action is not an accomplished fact, but a wish, an obligation, a possibility or an expectation merely: He will go / He shall go / He may go / He expects to go. There is always more or less an element of uncertainty or intention in it. The purest form is what we call “simple future”: He will die soon, or He is going to die soon. These forms may be arranged under the following heads:—

(1) Simple future: I shall come again / He will die soon.
(2) Intention: I will come again.
(3) Command: Come! / You shall come this afternoon.
(4) Possibility: I may come again.
(5) Obligation: I am to see him this afternoon.

13.31. “Shall” and “Will.”—The English shall and will seem to cause a great deal of difficulty among Chinese
