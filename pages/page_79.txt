EMPHATIC ASSERTION
57
by double negatives (§ 3.45) and by a method of interrogative affirmation (§ 3.46). I do feel sorry for him is an emphatic way of saying that I feel sorry for him. Other examples are:—

Do tell me everything you know; otherwise I cannot help you.
'Tisn't (=It isn't) that he doesn't know it. He does know it, but he does not want to let people know.
Well, I confess I did go to the gambling house.
You need not lie to me. You did go to that place, and many people saw you there.

The word do or did is always stressed in these places. Ladies are especially fond of using this form of emphasis even when no great emphasis is meant. E.g.—

Please do write me often.
I do hope that you will quit drinking.
I do fear something is wrong, dear.
Do be kind to this poor little boy.

Sometimes we show emphasis by merely stressing the verb. Sometimes various advv. are used. The force of I am sure is already weakened by constant use, so that I am sure you will find him is actually less assertive than the short categorical statement You will find him. Generally the shorter a statement is, the more forceful it is. I dare say is even weaker, and simply means “It is quite possible,” or “You are probably right.” The Americans are very fond of using you bet, or you bet your life or sure (with long-drawn-out pronunciation like sh-oo-r) as a means of assertion or affirmation.

You are funny. (Emphasis by stress or accent.)
Do I look like a banker only? I am a banker. (Said by a self-satisfied merchant.)
