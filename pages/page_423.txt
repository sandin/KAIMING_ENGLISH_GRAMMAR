THE COMMA
401

She sings French songs, speaks the French language fluently
and plays the piano.

But we do not always speak like that in real life, and
therefore such sentences may give the impression of
artificiality or stiffness.

(b) Where we have two modifiers to one noun, the
second modifier or modifying phrase is often separated
by two or one comma.

She bought a very expensive, but very good-looking (,) hat.
He was a clever, but undependable (,) assistant.

Logically, we should have two commas, but phonetically,
only one is required, as no one makes a pause between the
last two words.

(c) Common phrases or advv. may often be inserted
without commas.

Therefore (,) I went.
That was (,) of course (,) a fact.
Of course he knew. (Better than: Of course, he knew.)
Bu': This was, logically speaking, incorrect.
To be sure, he was to blame.
The envelope, strange to say, had been cut open.

(d) Commonsense could decide the rest for securing
the greatest degree of clearness.

Any militarily weak nation would, like China, when she was

might be misinterpreted to refer to any nation; therefore,
omit the comma after China and read:)
Any militarily weak nation would, like China when she was
invaded by Japan, resort to the boycott, etc.
