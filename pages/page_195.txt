DIRECT AND INDIRECT STATEMENTS 175

In indirect statements, we do not bind ourselves to use the exact words, and naturally change the person of pronn. and the tense of vbb. according to the actual meaning.

Indirect questions have already been discussed in § 3.64. In indirect questions, we do not use the “inverted order” of vb and subject:—

Peterson asked: “Are you coming?” (Direct)
Peterson asked if he was coming. (Indirect)

While indirect statements are introduced by that, indirect questions are introduced by if, whether, how, when, what, etc. so that we get the following phrases:—

ask if                 ask why
ask whether           ask when
ask how               ask where
ask what              ask for what reason
ask who               ask by what means, etc.

Look up § 3.64 again for review.

In indirect commands and requests, the vbb. are usually expressed with the helping words should, would, are to, were to, etc. When the vb. alone is used, the infinitive form is used both for the past and present tenses. For example:—

It is our wish that he leave the city now.
It was our wish that he leave the city at once.

We may say:

It was our wish that he should leave the city at once,

which means the same thing as leaves. But to say:

It was our wish that he left at once
