ANIMALS & PERSONS OF DIFFERENT SEX 105
human beings, may be used in the common gender, as her
part in man's (mankind's) history of progress and No man
can tell. Further examples of common gender are: cousin,
parent, relative, lover, author (although authoress may also
be used for a woman author), worker, journalist, reporter,
editor, doctor (doctress is chiefly in jocular use), missionary,
nurse (there are male nurses), fool, neighbour, barber,
hair-dresser, secretary, scientist, chairman (besides the
modern chairwoman), etc. The word woman can always
be added to these words (woman doctor, woman worker),
while the word lady is limited to the higher classes (lady
doctor, lady teacher, lady scientist). Likewise girl is used
for young girls, as in girl reporter, girl worker.

4.72. Animals and Persons of Different Sex.—It is
natural that we have different words for animals and
persons of different sex. In the case of animals, we do
not trouble to distinguish the sex of frogs, snakes, flies,
and grasshoppers by different words, while we have dif-
ferent words for animals which are closer to us, as bull,
cow, cock, hen. When we want to include both sexes with
these one-sex words, the only way is to use both, as ten
brothers and sisters (7 brothers and 3 sisters, or 3 brothers
and 7 sisters, or any other combination). Some commoner
examples are:—

Mas.             Fem.              Mas.             Fem.
king             queen             landlord         landlady
father           mother            prince           princess
brother          sister            count (earl)     countess
uncle            aunt              duke             duchess
