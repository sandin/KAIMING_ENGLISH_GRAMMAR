MODIFICATION

The picture was nothing wrong (meaning not at all wrong; in
some constructions, we find even nothing plus a participle,
as “nothing daunted,” meaning not at all daunted).
Go one better (American slang=go one step or one degree further).
You haven’t the ghost of a chance (=a ghostly chance).
He had a hell of a time (=hellish time).
That rascal of a fellow (=rascally fellow).
That shiftless, sin-smelling drunkard of a husband (=husband who
is a drunkard).
You will catch a death of a cold (=a deadly cold).

It will be seen that in the last five examples, the first n.
really modifies the second n. and is thus its logical modi-
fier, although grammatically the second n. seems to modify
the first. Thus in hell of a time, logically hell modifies
time, while grammatically of a time modifies hell.

Vbb., because of their very nature, are very seldom
used as modifiers. This is because, when they are used as
modifiers, they generally take the form of a participle or
an infinitive phrase, and these will be studied in the
following sections. When they are not participles or
infinitives, they generally have a subject expressed or
understood, and this makes it difficult for them to act as
modifiers. There are, however, some cases where an inde-
pendent clause with a finite vb. has become amalgamated
into adv., as in the following:—

Maybe you are mistaken; maybe I can do it (from independent
clause it may be, meaning perhaps).
I will go away temporarily, say (from let us say), for three
weeks, and then come back.
Bring him in here, willy-nilly (from will he, nill he=whether he
likes it or not).
