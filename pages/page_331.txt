11.32. Use of the Passive.—Apparently there may not be any great difference between Jack kills Jill and Jill is killed by Jack, which seem to be two ways of saying the same thing. There are many cases, however, where the passive form is necessary or much more preferable to the active form. Thus when a reporter found a man murdered, without being able to learn who murdered him, evidently all he could report would be “A man was murdered in his flat on Avenue B—, etc.” For in the passive voice, we can avoid mention of the subject (doer) of the action. Sometimes the doer is unknown (as in the above example), or very indefinite (It is said—by whom?), or well understood (A student was dismissed—by the school authorities, of course), or of less interest to the hearer and the speaker than the party affected by the action (A house was burnt—we are interested in the house burnt and not in the fire which burnt it). Sometimes it is indelicate to mention who was the author of a deed, as in the following examples:—

So the Kuomintang was turned into a personal organ and China was sold through the disgraceful treaty.
