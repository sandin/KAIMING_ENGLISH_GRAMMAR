MINE, THINE, ETC.
149

Chinese students usually say “tell them,” “see him”—
which is all wrong. Only when these words are empha-
sized do we accept them, as “for me, not for you.”

7.21. Mine, Thine, etc.—Study the following:—

This is my book.                          It is mine.
This is her ring.                         The ring is hers.
You bring your book.                      They will bring theirs.
It is my pleasure.                        The pleasure is mine.
It is your fault.                         The fault is yours.

Notice when the nn. used after my, thy, etc. are
understood, we change the pronn. into mine, thine, etc.
Thus we have the following series, with the exception of
its.

my—mine                                  our—ours
thy—thine                                your—yours
his—his                                  their—theirs
her—hers                                 whose—whose

A very peculiar use is seen in the following:—

Our friend.                               A friend of ours.
My pen.                                   This pen of mine.
Their relative.                           A relative of theirs.
Jimmy’s (his) brother.                    A brother of Jimmy’s (his).
Your boy-husband.                         That boy-husband of yours.
Your filial son.                          That filial son of yours.
Her uncle’s book.                         That book of her uncle’s.

There is always a tinge of familiarity implied in such
expressions. Notice that we cannot say that your son or
this my pen, but must say that son of yours or this pen of
mine (cf. § 8.30).

Exercise 45. Put in the words mine, thine, etc. and omit the nn.
wherever you can in the following sentences 1-5, and use a ... of
yours, that ... of mine, etc. in the sentences 6-10.
