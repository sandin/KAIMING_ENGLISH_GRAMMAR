Where is the money you gave me? He has money, influence and power.
Take up a business.                          Business is as usual.
Learn a trade.                                Trade is at a standstill.

Exercise 64. Take some of the above phrases (go to school, in
school, after class, etc.) and some of the nn. of action, and concrete
or abstract nn., and use them in sentences of your own. Show the
reason why the article is used or omitted. His, my, this, etc. may be
used instead of the article.

(3) The article is often dropped in regular phrases,
as the soldiers in uniform (not in a uniform, or in
uniforms), and translate word by word (not one word by one
word), learn it by heart (not by the heart). Often, it is
possible to insert the article or the words some, any, my,
etc., when the meaning is more concrete and specialized
and the phrase loses therefore its general character.
Thus, we say, at last or at the last, by chance or by a queer
chance, beyond question or beyond any question, go by train
or go by the next train. See if you can use the following
phrases:—

week by week                                  go by boat
day by day                                    come by train
step by step                                  set foot on China 到中國
man for man 以個人比較                       came on foot 步行而來
tit for tat 報復                              leave word for him 留言
in case, in this case                         in point of fact 事實上
in fact, in actual fact                       in view of 為…起見
by chance, by some chance                     clean house 掃除積弊
at heart, at his heart                        play tennis
by mistake, by a bad mistake                  at night
eat by mouth                                  at noon

(4) Finally, articles may be omitted before nn. used
as modifiers, which approach adj. in meaning:—
