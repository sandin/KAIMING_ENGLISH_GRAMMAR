Furthermore, should is also used in connexion with lest, for fear, in case, and other subjective clauses.

I shall send him a written word, lest he should forget.
Lest you should think I was unwilling to help you, I am enclosing herewith some money.
I am putting the money in different banks, in case (lest) some of them should fail.
He is doing it for fear (lest) people should misunderstand him.
In case you should need my help, just let me know.
