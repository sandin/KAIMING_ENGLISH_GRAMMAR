vbb. in the English language which are becoming auxiliaries, but which have not developed so far as the other words. That is to say, they are used exactly like must, can, etc. in questions and negative sentences, but not in affirmative sentences:—

Need                   Dare                  (Can, etc.)
Quest. Need he go?     Dare he go?           (Can he go?)
Neg.   He need not go. He dare not go.        (He cannot go.)
Aff.   He needs to go. He dares to go.        (He can go.)

In the affirmative sentence, we add an -s in the 3rd person sing., and we do not omit the to. Besides Dare he go? / Need he go? we can also say Does he dare to go? / Does he need to go? And besides He dare not go / He need not go, we can say He does not need to go / He does not dare to go.

Notice, however, that to is usually omitted in the following negative sentences, even though the phrase dare not or need not does not directly occur:—

No one need know about it.
No one dare say a word about it.
You need tell no one.
Under no circumstances dare he betray the secret.
I need hardly tell you that . . . . (hardly=almost not)

The word please sometimes drops, and sometimes retains, the to behind it:—

Please ring the bell.            Please don’t (or do not) forget.
Please to ring the bell.          Please not to forget.

The words make, bid, etc. will be treated under § 9.91.

Exercise 76. Transform the following orally into negative sentences and questions, either with do or without do, over and over again until you can do it quickly without mistake.
