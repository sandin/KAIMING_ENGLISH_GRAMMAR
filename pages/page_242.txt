MODIFICATION

In all these cases, if we analyze carefully, we see that the modifiers modify only half of the modified words. Heavy eaters does not mean that the eaters are heavy, but that only eating is heavy: they eat heavily. Good haters does not mean the haters are good, but only they can hate very well. Close prisoners are not “close” at all (for that would make no sense), but they are closely guarded. Perfect strangers are far from “perfect,” but are only perfectly strange to us. The last three examples in parentheses represent a shifting of ranks not from adv. + vb., but from adv. + adj.—from comparatively easy and positively wrong to comparative ease and positive wrong.

3. Among you three, Chu-lien is going to lose most heavily in this deal.
4. He writes quickly. He writes rapidly.
5. He came here only a short while ago. (New-comer.)
6. He has been in this country a long time. (Old-timer.)
7. This man talks glibly.
8. That man can be easily victimized or cheated.

(b) Adj. + Adj. There is a steady tendency in the English language to cut out the adv. ending -ly in places where briefness and force are wanted for effect, especially in colloquial speech. Thus Come quick is now more common than Come quickly, because the adding of the -ly seems to decrease the force of the word. One might say He is devilishly handsome, and She is deucedly clever, but it is
