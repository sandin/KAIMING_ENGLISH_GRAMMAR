EXPRESSIONS OF SIZE AND DISTANCE

the basis, and the other names have prefixes like deca-, kilo-, deci-, milli-, which have the same meaning as in the “gram” series (cf. §6.20). The practically useful words here are:—

meter = 39 inches, a little over a yard
kilometer = 1,000 meters, about two-thirds of a mile
centimeter = 100th of a meter, about 1/3 of an inch

In the old system, there are the following expressions:

inch = 英寸, about 0.73 Chinese in.
foot = 12 inches, about 8.7 Chinese in.
yard = 3 feet = 2.6 Chinese ft.
mile = 1,760 yds., about 3.3 Chinese li
furlong = 220 yds., or 8th of a mile
fathom = 6 ft. or 2 yds. (especially in measuring depth of water)
5′ 4″ = five feet four inches

For the plural, we almost always add an -s to these terms, except when they are used as modifiers, as in a five-foot shelf, a two-yard stick, three inch (or inches) wide. Learn also the following expressions of size, and surface and cubic measures:—

four square feet (4 sq. ft.) = four squares, each of which is one foot long and one foot wide; three sq. ft. = three such squares = 三方尺
four feet square = a square whose sides are all four feet long = 四尺見方
square mile = 方哩
acre = 4,840 sq. yds. = 英畝 (the Chinese mow is a highly shifting measure)
three feet long by four feet wide, or three by four (often written 3′×4′)
four cubic feet = 四立方尺
twenty cubic centimeters
