32 PARTS OF SPEECH & CHANGE OF FUNCTION

2.33. Verbs Used as Adjectives: Participles.—You have probably already learnt about the two forms of vbb. called present and past participles. A participle simply means a word serving in two functions, as vb. and as adj. We can turn any vb. into an adj. by the use of these participial forms.

The present participle is always formed by adding -ing to the vb. The past participle is formed by adding -ed for the regular vbb. and is quite various for the irregular vbb. The present participle expresses active or incomplete action, while the past participle expresses passive or complete action. Boiling water means hot water that is still boiling, while boiled water means water that has been boiled, which may or may not be hot. We can have iced boiled water, but we can never have iced water that is still boiling. In the same way, a drowning man is just going down the water and not dead yet, while a drowned man has already been drowned. We can hear cries for help from a drowning man, but not from one who is already drowned. Similarly, a stirring speech is a speech that stirs people, and an excited crowd is a crowd that has been excited or stirred by the speaker’s exciting speech. Compare the difference in the following phrases and sentences:—

The book is interesting. It interests me. I am interested in it.
