FOREWORD

The average senior middle school class should not attempt the covering of the whole volume in the same school year, unless the teacher is confident of the students' ability to do so; but if half a volume is used each year (beginning from Senior Two) along with some proper reading material, it will be found useful and interesting as a means of increasing the students' power of expression.

Judging from the average standard of the present college students, this grammar may also be profitably used by a freshman class. A more elementary grammar, written in Chinese, but based on the same notional principles and devoted to drills on idioms, will be prepared for the more elementary classes. The present grammar will then serve as a useful book of reference for the teachers who may use this more elementary book of drills.

Thanks are due to Mr. Chang Pei-lin of Kaiming Book Company for compiling the Index of Subjects and Terms and for valuable assistance in seeing the book through the press.
