370 TIME OF ACTION

time. Notice that we use after three days, three days after, three days before and three days ago for the past, while we use in three days, in a week, in a minute generally for the future: I shall come back in a minute. (He finished it in a week has a different meaning.) Notice also that there is a difference between always and often, both of which are usually translated by the Chinese word ch'ang (常). He is always like that should be strictly translated by “他老是這樣” and He is often like that should be translated by “他常這樣.” Presently does not mean at present, but by and by: I shall attend to this presently / Presently (Soon afterwards) he appeared again. Every and next are not preceded by prepp.—every time, next Wednesday, next month.
