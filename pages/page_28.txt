they are never taught this English distinction between
fact and fancy.

On the other hand, we can think of Chinese notions
which are not found in English. Thus the Chinese ten-
tative action, as in ta-i-ta (打一打), or hsi-i-hsi (洗一洗), is
difficult to express in English, because the English gen-
erally do not have this notion, although they sometimes
express it in saying take a look, have a taste (=看一看, 尝一
尝). Our Chinese ideas of family relationships with a very
sharp sense (or notion) of superiority and inferiority and
sex distinction, as in the different ranks of brothers,
cousins, nephews, uncles and aunts (哥哥, 弟弟, 表妹, 堂
姊, 外甥, 姪女, 舅, 丈, 妗, 姨) are difficult to express in Eng-
lish, because the English people generally do not make
much of such distinctions. In English, the wife’s bro-
ther, the husband’s brother, the older sister’s husband,
and the younger sister’s husband are all called brothers-
in-law.

1.32. English grammar should, therefore, teach us the
English ways of thinking and expression. We should learn
to say the whiteness of a white horse (not white of white
horse), over sixty (not sixty more), in three minutes (not
three minutes more), I should think so (not always I think
so), It would be all right (not always It is all right) and the
poor and the rich (not always poor people and rich people).
It should teach us always to say He is afraid (not He
afraid), He becomes tired (not He tired), and always to say
It rains, instead of the Chinese Rain already. To learn
these English ways of thinking and expression is the ob-
ject of our study of English grammar.
