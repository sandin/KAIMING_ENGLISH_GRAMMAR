CHAPTER IV
PERSONS, THINGS AND THEIR GENDER

4.10. Classes of Things.—In this chapter, we shall study the English notions regarding the classes of things that are expressed by the nouns. We have seen already (§ 2.15) that the English nouns may denote visible things (tables, chairs), invisible things (air, noise, possibility, power), or half visible and half invisible things (government, applause, happiness, middle, end). They may denote a concrete thing (table, chair), an action or event (promotion, examination, the fall of a government), or a condition (poverty, danger, prosperity) or a quality (kindness, stupidity, thinness). All these are regarded as nouns from the English grammatical point of view. To these we must add also the noun clauses, such as That he is dead (is certain), How much he took (nobody knows). They thus include more than the Chinese notion of事物 (or “things and events”), for 事物 cannot include the abstract qualities (品性, as kindness, thinness).

These nouns have been classified in different ways by different grammarians, chiefly according to their meaning, such as “common nn.,” “proper nn.,” “material nn.” We shall soon see that such hard and fast distinctions are by no means easy to establish or strictly logical. Still, without trying to put all the nn. into any one system of classification, we can, and Englishmen do, consider the nn. as belonging to different classes expressing different notions. The following distinctions must be made clear in the student’s mind.
