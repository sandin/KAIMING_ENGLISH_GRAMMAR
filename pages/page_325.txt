INTRANSITIVE VBB. AND PREPP. 303

[v.i. and v.t.]... “Turn up (soil) with spade or other implement or claws &c.” [v.t., because ‘soil’ is put in parentheses]... ‘d. [=dig] the soil (down, deep, &c.)’ [v.i., because ‘the soil’ is not put in parentheses]... “make (hole &c.) thus” [the fact that ‘hole’ is put in parentheses shows we can say ‘dig a hole,’ therefore v.t.]... “bring (buried object) up or out thus” [v.t.]... “make way into &c. thus” [v.i., we can say ‘dig into’]... “thrust (one’s nails, point) into something or in” [v.t. we can say ‘dig his nails into something’ or ‘dig it in’]... “(fig.) [figuratively] make search (for facts &c., into documents &c.) or find out by search” [we can say ‘dig for facts,’ ‘dig into documents,’ both vv.i., but we can also say ‘dig something out,’ v.t.].
