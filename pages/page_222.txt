DETERMINATION

He was not man enough to confess his mistake.
Mr. Hsü, poet and painter, arrived yesterday.
I met Mr. Hsü, the brother of Hsü Tien-hsi and husband of Su-
cheng (second the usually omitted).
They have elected him president of the company.
He acted as secretary to Li Yuan-hung.

Indetermination

8.80. Indetermination.—We have studied now the
various means of expressing determination, whether
definite or indefinite (a and the), and of making generaliza-
tions (§ 8.71). It remains now to study how the idea of
lack of determination is expressed in English. The com-
mon phrases are:—

Marry any old fool for a husband.
Pay it in any old way you want.
Pay it in whatever way you want.
I will do it, whatever he says.
Whatever you do, don't offend him again.
Whatever you think of it, I am going to get married to this girl.
Is there any chance whatever of our escape?
He has no friend whatever in this city.
He cannot do it, however he tried.
He cannot do it, no matter how he tried.
He will not consent, no matter how hard you try to persuade him.
No matter what you think, it is I who am going to get married.
No matter what you do, don't offend him again.
I will do it, no matter what he says
You can pay me at any time, no matter when.
In any case, there is no use discussing it now.
Anyhow, it is too late now.
The boat floated wherever it pleased.
Wherever Mary went, the little lamb was sure to go.
Wherever there is a stream of water with fish in it, there you may
look for the kingfisher.
