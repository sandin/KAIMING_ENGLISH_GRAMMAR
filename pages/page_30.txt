THE SCIENCE OF EXPRESSION

(always, never, soon, three times a week, etc.) and the conjunctions regarding time (until, since, as soon as), e.c.

This may be called a notional grouping, and the different chapters are arranged according to notional groups or categories.

In this way, we study the changes of different parts of speech also, but only in connexion with the notions which these changes help to express. For instance, we do not learn the expression He has returned just as a form in the “indicative mood, present perfect, third person singular” (as in the old grammars), but as a form expressing a condition, and contrast it with He returned as expressing an action. He has returned means the same thing as He is at home now, while He returned expresses a totally different notion, viz. that He took the journey home, or He turned back. Thus we learn in each case how to use the grammatical form studied.

1.41. Outline of the Course.—In this book, we shall follow the second or new way, which is according to notional groups. We shall first study the parts of speech and see how words used in different parts of speech (nouns used as adjectives, adjectives used as nouns, etc.) are changed. This gives us a general idea of the relationship between word-class (part of speech) and word-form, and makes us acquainted with the formal endings like -cy, -ness, -ly (secrecy, goodness, decidedly: Ch. II).* Next we shall study the different moods of sentences, and learn the
