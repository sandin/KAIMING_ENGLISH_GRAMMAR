SHIFTED RANKS
221

more idiomatic to say devilish handsome and deuced clever. Similarly, extraordinary good luck and real wicked people are more expressive than extraordinarily good and really wicked. So also, we have the -ly regularly dropped in dead, hard and fast as adv., as dead drunk, dead pale, dead tired, hard hit, hard pressed, run fast. Notice that in the following examples, it is always adj. expressing emphasis or intensity that are subject to this strange shifting of duty, which proves that the desire for brevity and force is the cause of this apparent shifting. Those examples not quite accepted in literary English are marked with an asterisk.*

(A) burning hot soup          *mighty glad             bitter cold
shocking bad novel           *jolly nice               biting cold
real wicked guy              *jolly good               blazing hot
excellent good friends       devilish handsome
real stubborn fellow         deuced clever            (C) red-hot
extraordinary good luck      confounded difficult     snowy-white-
                             *wondrous fine            ashy-pale
(B) *exceeding small         *terrible strong         bitter-sweet
    *exceeding hot           dead tired               dark red
    *thundering good         dead drunk               deep blue
    passing strange          dead asleep              light green
    *uncommon fine           stark naked              wide open

One notices that the examples under “A” could easily be explained as having a real adj. in the first modifier. Thus shocking bad novel may mean a novel both bad and shocking, as well as shockingly bad. but real stubborn fellow must be explained as real stubborn-fellow, and excellent good friends must be explained as excellent good-friends. Good
