412 ECONOMY OF EXPRESSION

He was disappointed at their attitude.
He was disappointed to hear that they did not care.
He was disappointed that they took no interest in it.

16.22. Change of Phrase-Modifiers into Word-Modifiers.—Many phrases are used as modifiers and can be converted into word-modifiers. Thus, instead of saying “We are living in a China torn by civil wars,” one might write more simply “We are living in a war-torn China.” “If you go through the famine-stricken district” is simpler and better than “if you go through the district stricken by famine.” How such modifiers are formed has already been fully explained under § 9.26.

Ellipsis

16.30. Dropping of Auxiliary Words.—A few examples should suffice here—

They had come and (had) gone.
He had inherited and (had) spent a fortune.
She was trying to start a ball, and he (was trying) to prevent it.
She was trying to get into society, and he (was trying) to get away from it.

16.31. Dropping of Principal Words.—This kind of ellipsis is especially common in answers to questions.

Would you join? I should love to (join you).
I should like to fry chicken or bake potatoes, but do not know how (to do it).
He has declared bankruptcy. You don’t tell me (that this is true)!
Would you speak at the next meeting? I would rather not (do (that).
