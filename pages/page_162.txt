6.50. Expressions of Shape: English Shape-Blindness.—
A great difference is noticeable when we compare the English and Chinese notions of shape. Whereas the Chinese seem unable to think of a thing without calling up its shape also, the English language, looked at from the purely Chinese point of view, seems to be spoken by a race of shape-blind people. This is another instance of the highly concrete and synthetic way of Chinese thinking.

English suffices with a fish, a table, a bookcase, an ox, etc. But in Chinese, we have, for instance:—

一條魚 i t’iau yu (one “strip” fish)
一張桌子 i chang chuo-ts (one “flat piece” table)
