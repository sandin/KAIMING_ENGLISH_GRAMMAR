Numerals

5.30. Numerals, Fractions and Multiples.—The greatest difficulty in English counting for the Chinese student is the expression of the Chinese idea of wan (萬), which is “ten thousand” in English. When the student wishes to express his idea of wan in terms of thousands, he must remember to multiply it by ten. The next thing to remember is that a hundred wan makes a “million,” and hence a thousand wan is simply “ten million.” No end of confusion has been caused by this difference in notion.

one wan = ten thousand                      10,000.
ten wan = hundred thousand                  100,000.
hundred wan = one million                   1,000,000.
thousand wan = ten million                  10,000,000.
ten wan wan = one billion                   1,000,000,000.

The English way of counting is really very clear through its division into threes in the reading of long sums; thus 1 001,000 is easily seen to be one million and one thousand, while 10,010,000 is ten million and ten thousand. Also there is more regard for accuracy in English statements
