CONDITIONAL NEGATION
67

On the other hand, the repetition of not in separate phrases is quite necessary to make the meaning clear. We say, for instance, He wouldn't come to your house, not even the King himself should ask him to / He would never take opium, not even as a medicine / He would not take a bath, not even if you offer him all the chocolates in the world. In the same way, we use neither ... nor as being probably clearer than either ... or in the following, although either ... or would be also correct: He cannot write a single decent Chinese essay, neither in peh-hua, nor in the literary language.

3.57. Conditional Negation.—The repetition of not in negative clauses or phrases discussed in the preceding paragraph is quite often used in English. If a man asks you if you could write an English letter for him, and you do not mean to refuse him entirely, although you are too busy at the present moment, your answer should be “Not now, I am afraid” (cf. Pekingese 現在不). This may be called conditional negation, or partial negation. Following are some more examples:—

(Question asked on a September morning:) Who will come and take a sea bath with me?—Not I. (=Others may go, but not I.)

Didn't he give the fellow some money also?—Not he! (=He is a miser.)

Are you going on the same boat with him?—Not if I can help it. (=I will not go on the same boat, if I can avoid it.)

Hasn't he published a book of poems?—Not any that I know of.

Will the foreigners never be friendly to China?—Some of them, yes, but not all. Or: Not until you show them a big navy.

Will Japan ever stop her aggressions on China?—No, no, not until we take measures of actual resistance.
