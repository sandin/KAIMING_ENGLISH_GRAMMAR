114 NUMBER AND QUANTITY

considered regular plurals. There are some English plurals which do not add an -s, or which add nothing at all.

(b) No Change:

450 sheep.
A lot of fish, salmon, trout.
Keep fowl, sheep, swine.
Shoot 20 snipe, wild duck, deer.
Three dozen [adj.] apples.
Three dozen [n.] of apples.—but: dozens of them, did it dozens of times, pack it in dozens.
Three score and ten (=seventy).
Three hundred [adj.] bottles.
Take three hundred [n.].—but: have seen hundreds of them, hundreds and thousands.

Most of these keep the singular form because they are regarded as collectives (cattle as a whole, fish as a whole, three dozen as a whole), or as mass-words (snipe, duck, deer—hunted because of their flesh, which is a mass-word). When these words are not so regarded, we can use the plural forms with -s (some fishes, ducks or fowls in the backyard). In our human selfishness, we often think of the flesh in the hunted animals, and forget that they are individual beings. This is especially clear in the phrase “fish, flesh and fowl” (魚, 肉, 雞鴨等). Cattle, swine and sheep are never used with -s as collective nn. Dozen, score, hundred, thousand generally do not take an -s when used
