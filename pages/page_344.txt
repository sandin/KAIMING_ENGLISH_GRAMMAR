Beginning, Continuation and End

11.50. Beginning, Continuation and End.—The three aspects of beginning, continuation and end (inceptive, continuative and cessative) are expressed in English by means of the expressions: (1) begin to, begin —ing, (2) keep —ing, etc. and (3) stop —ing, or cease —ing.

(1) Begin to, etc. This aspect seems to be used in English to a greater extent than in Chinese. On this account, it should be more carefully studied. Say “I begin to suspect” and “I am beginning to think” (疑心起來, 正萌此意) instead of “I suspect” and “I think” when the suspicion or change of opinion is a gradual process. Other examples are:—

begin to realize
began to understand
began to get tired of
began to repent
begin to think otherwise

am beginning to suspect
am beginning to fear
is beginning to decay
has begun to be talked about
had begun to play

Begin followed by a vb. in —ing is also often used: begin building at once, began telling me a story, began washing his car.
