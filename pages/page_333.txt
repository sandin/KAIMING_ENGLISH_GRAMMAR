11.34. Active and Passive Adjj.—Notice also the active
and passive action implied in the adjj.—contemptuous (鄙視
的)—contemptible (可鄙的); desirous (願望)—desirable (合意
的); credulous (輕信的)—credible (近情可信的); incredulous
(懷疑的)—incredible (荒唐難信的); forgetful (易忘)—unfor-
getable (難忘); respectful (敬意的)—respectable (可敬的).
The endings -able, -ible generally suggest the passive
aspect (eatable, audible, visible, countable, unbelievable, per-
missible, legible, questionable, understandable, intelligible,
digestible), but sometimes also suggest the active aspect
(susceptible, capable of receiving; perishable, easy to perish;
forcible, by use of force). Curiously enough, suspicious
has both the active meaning of “prone to suspect” (He is
suspicious by nature, 生性猜忌) and the passive meaning
of “arousing suspicion” (His conduct was very suspicious,
形跡可疑). Chinese students often misunderstand the
aspect denoted by the words fearful, frightful, terrible,
etc. It is wrong to say I am very fearful for I fear very
much (a thing, it, is fearful, but a person fears). Thus we
have—
Incorrect Correct
