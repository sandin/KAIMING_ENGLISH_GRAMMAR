CHAPTER XIII
TIME OF ACTION

13.10. The Time Scheme: Present, Past and Future.—
The usual division of time is into the three main classes:
present, past and future, as represented by I saw, I see
and I shall see. In each of these three main divisions,
one can state that something has already taken place
before it, and something is going to take place after it.
Thus we get nine tenses altogether, as shown in the
following scheme:—

Before-past         I had seen
Simple past        I saw
After-past         I was (going) to see

Before-present     I have seen
Simple present     I see
After-present      I am going to see / I shall see

Before-future      I shall have seen
Simple future      I shall see / I am going to see
After-future       I shall be going to see

Notice that there is an overlapping in the central
division “present.” “Before-present” is really past, and
“after-present” is really future. In English, the dis-
tinction between before-present and past is preserved
through the forms I saw and I have seen, whereas in
French, for instance, “I have seen” (j’ai vu) is regularly
used for the past. Whether the grammatical distinction

future really come together in English, because what
