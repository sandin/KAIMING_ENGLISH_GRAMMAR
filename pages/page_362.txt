12.41. Passive Intransitive Vbb.—It is of course impossible to form the passive voice with vv.i. which have no objects. If I say She slept there, it is impossible to say that something was slept by her. But vv.i. which are connected with a prep. phrase can be put in the passive voice. If I say No one has slept in this bed, I can change it into the passive by saying that The bed has not been slept in, meaning that the person who used to sleep in it did not come last night.
