8.30. Possessive Pronouns and Nouns.—We have studied in §§7.20-7.21 the possessive pronn. my, your, and mine, yours, etc. Nouns in the possessive case add an “apostrophe s” ('s) in the singular, as bird’s, person’s. These are all true determinative words, and are easy to use. The only peculiar forms of the possessives in ’s are exemplified by the following:

(a) Plural nouns:                           (b) Singulars in s:
birds’ nest(s)                             James’s horse
three days’ journey                        Jones’s children
persons’ faults                            Charles’s letter
others’ ideas                              Pythagoras’s teaching
friends’ help                              Ulysses’ Return
