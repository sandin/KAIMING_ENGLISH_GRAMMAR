"THAT" AS A DEFINING REL. PRON. 247

The man (who came here this morning) was my school friend.

The rel. pron. who serves as a regular pronominal subject in the relative clause who to morning, but it acts also as a conjunction connecting the clause with its antecedent man. The whole relative clause is used to modify the antecedent man.

In the sentence—

We came to the room (where the emperor used to study and talk with the great scholars),

we have the rel. adv. where serving as an adv. in the clause where to scholars, and at the same time acting as a conj. to connect up the clause with the antecedent room.

The rel. promm. are who (whom, whose), which, that, as (preceded by such, the same, or as) and but (preceded by no one, etc.).

The relative advv. are where, when and why.

The use of these words will be studied in the following sections.

9.61. "That" as a Defining Rel. Pron.—It has already been stated in §4.61 that, of the three rel. pronn. who, which and that, who is used for persons, which for things, and that for both. There is a difference, however, between that and which in their usage, namely, that that is "defining" and which is commentative. It is a difference which is hard always to observe and which is not always observed. But the observing of this distinction would always insure correctness of idiom, besides making the sentences clearer in meaning.
