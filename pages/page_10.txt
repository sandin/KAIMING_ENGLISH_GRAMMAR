PREFACE

changing idioms, and not by putting on the grammatical
strait-jacket. Grammar, as the science of expression,
should be more subtle and less rigid; it should address
itself more to the speaker's intentions and less to the
rules and definitions. It should be more concrete and
wallow less in the terms of Latin origin. It should also be
more positive and less like a criminal code. It has been
the effort of the present author to replace such categorical
rules by observations on the present usage. The English
language is a living thing, and this is the only way to
deal adequately with it. It is hoped that, through this
means, the student will form a more intimate acquaintance
with modern English usage than is otherwise possible.

It remains only to acknowledge my great debt to all
previous writers on the subject who take the same views of
grammar as I do. My debt to Prof. Jespersen and his
Modern English Grammar and Philosophy of Grammar
will be evident to all users of the said books. I have incor-
porated his views and examples in this book on many
points, although, naturally, I have not dared to go quite
as far in the matter of new terminology in a book that is
intended for general school use. Thus, I have managed
to keep all the eight parts of speech intact, for instance.
Above all, I have derived courage from him, as well as
from Prof. Ferdinand Brunot and M. Henri Frei, for
this somewhat heretical venture. Thanks are also due to
the authors of the Concise Oxford Dictionary and Modern
English Usage for enlightening articles and examples.
