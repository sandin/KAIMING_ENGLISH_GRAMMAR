Degree of Difference

10.30. Degree of Difference.—The means of expressing the degree of difference between two objects is also worth studying. The prep. by is most commonly used in this connexion, as may be seen from the following examples:—

Tom is older than Jim by three years.
Jim is taller than Effie by an inch and half.
Busy Bee won (the horse race) by a neck.
This is by far the best way of meeting the difficulty.
We won by 2-0.
I missed the train by three minutes.
Gold has risen by three points.

(In the last three examples, comparison is implied.)

Nn. indicating measures are often used for this purpose without any introductory prepp.

Jim is an inch and half taller than Effie.
Tom is one pound heavier than Steward.
She is a year older than her younger brother.
They are miles apart.
Prof. McMurray is head and shoulders above the rest of the faculty in his scholarship.

Easily the best is also a common expression meaning “by far the best.”
