In Which, from Whom, etc.—It is most easy to make mistakes in employing the which and who constructions The thing that should constantly be borne in mind is that every rel. clause must have such a perfect construction in itself that it could be turned into an independent sentence.

We came to the room in which the emperor used to work.
