Wherein, whereof and wherefore (= in which, of which, for which reason) are not in common use today except in pedantic writing, poetry and legal documents, with the exception of wherefore as a n. in the phrase the whys and wherefores. Whereby (= by which) is more commonly used.

Whenever and wherever are used exactly like when and where in their constructions:—

Leave whenever you like.
Go wherever you like.
