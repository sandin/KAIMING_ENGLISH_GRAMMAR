HABITUAL ACTION AND ETERNAL TRUTHS 345
infinitesimal, ever-fleeting point of time only. Logically,
that time we call present is just a bare second, whereas
all that goes before it belongs to the past (even the last
second) and all that comes after it belongs to the future
(including the next second). It is because of this fact
that the present always encroaches upon the territory of
the past or the future. I have just seen him, nominally
called the present, really indicates a past action, and I
shall do it now indicates really that the action will take
place in the future. It is, therefore, very difficult t. “do”
anything in the present. There are very few things that
can be done in the present second. Hence, we practically
never express really present action by the simple present,
and use instead the present continuous: I am doing it now,
which expresses an extended period. The result is, either
we have done a thing, or are going to do it, or we are doing
it right now. For fuller illustrations, see § 11.10.

13.21. Habitual Action and Eternal Truths.—Actual-
ly, however, we do regard the present as something more
than a mere point of time. We often mean by it today,
or the present week, or even the present year. For
instance, we say I am staying at the X Hotel this week, or
We dine at eight this year, last year we dined at seven. The
last example indicates not really present action, but
merely a present habit. Or in the case of words like know,
believe, think and be (I know you are right / I believe you are
wrong), the suggestion is really that knowing or believing
covers a long time. Or again, we may express an eternal
truth when we say The earth moves around the sun, or at
least a general statement when we say A carriage has four
wheels / A hansom has two wheels / A statue stands in the
