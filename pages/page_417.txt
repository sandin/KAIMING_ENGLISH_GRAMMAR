COMPARISON AND CONFORMITY

In order to stop this trouble, the Government is ready to close
down the whole school.
We gave him a hundred dollars just in order to shut up his
mouth.
By way of illustrating what he meant, he produced a chart of
the club’s activities.
We should all work and labour, to the end that the new movement
may become a success.

15.48. Comparison and Conformity.—The use of conjj.
for expressing comparison (more than, as . . . as) presents
many grammatical peculiarities. This arises from the
fact that a comparison always implies two compared
members, whether nn., vbb., adjj., or whole groups of
words. Thus, if I compare my age with your age and say
I am three years older than you, the two members compared
are: I am old and you are old, or my age and your age.
Naturally, the full meaning is I am three years older than
you are old, but it would be foolish to repeat the second
member compared. Hence there is always a shortening
of the second member: in this case, shortened to you.
Also, in I know you better than he does, does in the second
member takes the place of knows you.

Such omissions and peculiarities in the second com-
pared member have already been fully studied in §§ 10.20
and 10.50. Thus we have—

Subject omitted: He eats more than (what) is good for him.
(See more than, §10.20, “1”)
Object omitted: He eats more than (what) he can digest.
(See more than, §10.20, “1”)
Subject and vb. omitted: I love you more than (I love) her.
Object and vb. omitted: I love you more than he (loves you).
