The danger is that the Chinese student is apt to use exclusively the periodic sentence type, with the result that the sentences will lose their informal character, which is necessary to an easy, flowing style.

The Analects says 齊景公曰: “善哉! 信如君不君, 臣不臣, 父不父, 子不子, 雖有粟, 吾得而食諸?” It would be impossible to put the dependent clause at the end and say, “吾得而食諸, 雖有粟? or 雖有粟, 信如君不君, 臣不臣, 父不父, 子不子?” But in the modern pen-hua style, it is possible to say: “你的話好啊! 我那裏有飯喫, 雖然有粟, 假如君不君, etc.” This is an improvement in the flexibility of the language, and makes possible a truly colloquial style.
