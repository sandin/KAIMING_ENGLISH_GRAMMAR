132 NUMBER AND QUANTITY

a big pearl and (after-thought) a number of smaller ones (are should be used). Mistakes of this kind are practically impossible to avoid in speaking, because the after-thought actually comes after the phrase there is is spoken already, and they are to be found in the writings of the best authors. Consequently, there is some justification for it even in writing. A lady whose attention is captivated and whose soul is set on fire by the sight of a big pearl naturally says—

There is a big pearl of wonderful roundness and lustre and a number of smaller ones in her necklace.

and it is hard to condemn her for her bad grammar. A punctilious writer would even purposely write:—

There is a big pearl of wonderful roundness and lustre in her necklace, and a number of smaller ones, besides.

Here is is better than are because the expression is rounded off by in her necklace for the first part, and the second part can be regarded as elliptical with there are understood.* Except in such constructions, however, one should generally think of his subject before he uses the verb. Following are correct examples:—

In the room are a table, a bed, and a piano.
Now come all trials and experiences that can happen to a man.
Under this roof are gathered today the most distinguished names of the country.
Under “university students” are included both post-graduates and under-graduates.
In this city are to be found both the most renowned scholars and the worst scoundrels of the country.
Here are the papers he left for you to read.
