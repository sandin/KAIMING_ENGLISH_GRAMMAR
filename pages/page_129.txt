CHAPTER V
NUMBER AND QUANTITY

5.10. The Notions of Number and Quantity.—There are things that can be numbered or counted (boy, book, ship, school), and things that cannot be numbered or counted (water, air, fame, honesty). This applies to all languages. It would be nonsense to say “one water,” “two water” either in Chinese or in English. For things that cannot be counted, however, we can express their quantity or amount, as “much water,” “a little water,” “a great deal of water,” and “a basin (or basinful) of water.” The difference expressed by one boy, two boys is called number (數), while the difference expressed by much water, little water is called quantity (量).

This distinction between number and quantity, however, is not kept in the Chinese notion of to (多) and shao (少). Thus, we say in Chinese 僧多粥少, disregarding the fact that monks can be counted, but congee cannot. In English, we have to say “many monks” (not “much monks”), but “little congee” (not “few congee”).
