10.32. Limitation.—We have already learnt the use of as . . . as in §10.20 “2.” A slightly different sense of limitation with reference to the degree of quality is suggested by such expressions as the following:—“I am willing to go so far and no farther,” or “He will stay as long (or so long) as his finances will permit.” The idea is that up to a certain point the degree of quality or action is admitted. The most typical example is the English phrase as far as . . . is concerned.
