ASPECTS OF ACTION

11.21. Intransitive Vbb. and Prepp.—Notice, however, that the difference between an v.i. and a v.t. is often purely syntactic, with sole reference of the verb’s ability or inability to take an object directly. An v.i. cannot have an object, but may have a prep. phrase modifying it. Thus, we cannot say He comes the room, but we can nevertheless say He comes into the room. Actually He comes (v.i.) into the room is the same as He enters (v.t.) the room, and He was looking (v.i.) at the game is the same as He was watching (v.t.) the game. Still, grammatically speaking, the intransitive actions of coming and looking are not supposed to have passed into the object directly, whereas the transitive actions of entering and watching are.

Owing to this difference, vv.i. are most frequently associated with definite prepp., so much so that the v.i. and the prep. often form a phrase with a very definite meaning. Thus look at means to watch, look upon (it as shameful, as a failure) means to regard, look up to means to respect, look down upon means to despise, look into (a company’s accounts) means to examine, and look for means to search. From the student’s point of view, the important thing is to observe the prep. associated with any v.i. and the new meaning which is thus developed. A good dictionary should always indicate what prepp. are used in what connexion.

The Pocket or Concise Oxford Dictionary always indicates clearly the prep. to be used in any particular connexion, and less clearly the transitive or intransitive use of the vbb. An illustration, with explanations, is given here, so that the student may derive full benefit from the use of these dictionaries. E.g., under dig, we are told (words in brackets [ ] are added for explanation):—“v.i. & t.”
