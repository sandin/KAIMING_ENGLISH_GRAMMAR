426 SYNOPSIS OF FORMAL GRAMMAR

statement (as, for instance, a supposition) may not at all be expressed by the subjunctive form, as in if he comes, where the form is indicative but the meaning is subjunctive [§ 14.20]. Also, the form if he should come is called “subjunctive future” by old grammars, but this is a serious misnomer, because this form really belongs to the general tense and its use is not confined to the future [§ 14.21].

The verb to be has special forms for the subjunctive mood: if I were [§ 14.23].

23. Tense.—There are three main tenses: present, past and future [§ 13.10]. Within each of these main tenses, there are other tenses, as follows:

                      Present         Past           Future
Indefinite            I come          I came         I shall come
Continuous            I am coming     I was coming   I shall be coming
Perfect               I have come     I had come     I shall have come
Perf. Contin.         I have been     I had been     I shall have been
                      coming          coming         coming (rare)

Regarding the use of the different tenses, see §§ 11.10, 13.21 (present indefinite), § 13.41 (the past), § 13.30 (the future), § 11.42 (the present perfect), § 11.43 (the continuous or progressive).

24. The Principal Parts.—The present, the past and the past participle are called the three principal parts of a verb. Verbs which form their past and past participle by having -ed added are called “regular” (kick—kicked—kicked), while verbs which do not do so are called irregular (draw—drew—drawn / pay—paid—paid) [§ 13.50].
