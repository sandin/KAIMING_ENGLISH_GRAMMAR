GENERAL PERSON
155

One will have to be more careful in speech, if one values one’s life.
You will have to be more careful in speech, if you value your
lives.
We shall have to be more careful in speech, if we value our lives.

We and you here are really used to denote general person.
In this sense, you is used only in a very familiar style.

The use of one requires special attention. Two
meanings may be distinguished here:—

(a) One hates his enemies and another forgives them.
(b) One hates one’s enemies and loves one’s friends.

In the first example, one is really the short form for one
man. In the second example, it denotes general person
and means the same thing as people. In this second sense,
it is better to use one’s, oneself, one in the rest of the
sentence instead of his, himself, he, him (“One knows
one’s, not his, own weakness”), although in America and
with some British writers, the use of he, his after one is
quite common. There is a third use for one, and that is as
a “modest” substitute for I:—

(c) After reading this, one gets a confused feeling about the
whole affair (= I get, etc.)
On inquiring further, one was told, etc. (= I was told, etc.)

The mixture of one, I, we, you, people for the same
person in the same sentence is in any case bad English.

Exercise 47. (I) Find out in the following whether the one
used denotes a general person or some particular one person or thing,
or is really a substitute for I:—

1. I saw one on the floor and picked it up.
2. One came in and was followed by another.
3. One cannot always spend money on others: he (preferably
one) must also plan for his (preferably one’s) own future.
