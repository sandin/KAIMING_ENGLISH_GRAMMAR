ABSOLUTE PARTICIPIAL PHRASE
239

phrase ought to modify the subject of the main clause, to
which the participial phrase is attached. Thus, in—

Having finished my lesson, I went home.

the participle having finished modifies the subject of the
main clause, I. It is, however, very easy to connect it up
with a subject which it logically cannot modify. One
might easily say:

This is wrong because it was not the teacher who had
finished the lesson. One ought to say, therefore—

Having finished my lesson, I was allowed by the teacher to go
home first.

Exercise 78. Study the following examples, and see why the
participles are wrongly connected. When it is difficult to make the
correct participial construction, other forms may be used, e.g., “As
I have finished my lesson,” or “When he was three years old.”

1. Being three years old, his father died.
2. Not knowing the strange town, the guide showed me the
different places worth visiting.
3. Having punished them enough already, cannot the prisoners be
set free now?
4. Being desirous to settle the accounts, will you please send me
the amount due by return post?
5. Being a movie fan, Colman and Barrymore are his favourites.
6. Being a despotic ruler, the people disliked him.

phrase, as we have seen, always begins with a participle
which modifies the subject of the main clause. It is thus
dependent on the main clause. We may have, however, a
participial phrase containing its own subject, as follows—
