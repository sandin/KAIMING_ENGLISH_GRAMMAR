THE DASH AND THE DOTTED LINE
405

or without breaking off of the grammatical structure. There is no denying the fact that in actual life our thoughts do not run off in perfect sentences, but often change midway to something else, or are otherwise interrupted, before the original intended sentence is finished. Consequently, the modern personal style often employs the dash to indicate this break of thought. Such sentences are often actually heard in conversations, so that their use in letters or familiar essays will contribute to that informal and easy-flowing effect.

(a) Sometimes, merely a pause is meant, as in the following sentence:—

When the mandarin fell on the floor, the first thing he would do on getting up was to readjust his tortoise-shell spectacles—leisurely, correctly.

(b) Abrupt breaks of thought are indicated in the following:—

In order to get a divorce, you'll have to—oh, well, we won't go into that.

I gave him full permission—in fact, I encouraged him, to examine the company's accounts.

We had no money, no food, not sufficient clothing, being stranded in a strange city, hounded by the police from place to place—you can imagine the rest.

(c) The dash is also used after a colon, a comma, or a full stop, serving also to indicate a longer pause.

The conditions are as follows:—
Dear Sir,—
For example,—

(d) The double dash is used exactly like the parentheses or brackets to indicate an inserted remark.
