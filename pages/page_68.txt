SENTENCE MOODS

speech; we do often use expressions that contain no verbs
in them, and yet the meaning is as complete as in any
sentence. Sometimes the verb is understood (not ex-
pressed), but this is not always true. We may say, for
the sake of grammar, that Fire! is really There is a fire
shortened. But this is psychologically not true: when
we cry out “Fire!”, we really only want to call people’s
attention to the fire. We may mean There is a fire, but
we may also mean Let everybody go and fight the fire! or we
may mean Oh! now my property is all gone, and what shall
I do? Our real meaning is just that word fire. Also,
ordinarily, a red rose is not a sentence, but in answer to
the question “What have you got in your hand?”, “A red
rose” is a good, clear and complete answer. Again, after
arranging with a friend to meet again on Saturday morn-
ing, we may say before parting:—

All right. Or—
All right. Saturday morning at ten. Or—
All right. Saturday morning at ten in the North Station and no
mistake.

All this is perfectly good English, although in written
English, we generally try to put in the proper verb.
In the same way, we have the following colloquial expres-
sions:—

Your turn. (=Now it is your turn.)
Next! (=Next boy, stand up, etc.)
Splendid! (=That’s good! Well done!)
How so? (=How can it be?)
A drink? (=Do you want a drink?)
Nothing doing. (=I will never do it.)
My mistake. (=It’s my mistake: it’s not your fault.)
Light, please. (=Please turn on the light.)
