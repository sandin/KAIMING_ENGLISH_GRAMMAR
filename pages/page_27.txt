NATIONAL DIFFERENCES

1.30. National Differences in Notions and Their Expressions.—All languages differ in their ways of expressing notions, and no one can say which language is right and which is wrong. All expressions are correct that serve to express our ideas clearly and adequately. *It rains, with a false subject, is as correct English as hsia-yu la, without any subject whatsoever, is correct Chinese.

There is the same notional distinction between It is all right and It would be all right, the latter being a more polite and less cocksure way of saying the former. *Many Chinese students can never learn to use these expressions, because
