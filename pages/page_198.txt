REPRESENTATION

Representation by Omission

7.70. Representation by Omission.—Grammar should teach one how to omit, as well as how to express, things. As Jespersen has wisely remarked, “Only bores want to express everything, but even bores find it impossible to express everything.” Jespersen mentions as example the case of a man purchasing a railway ticket at the station and saying “Two third Brighton return,” which really represents, “Would you please sell me two third-class tickets from London to Brighton and back again, and I will pay you the usual fare for such tickets.” Economy of speech is usually the motive for representation, whether by use of pronn. or by other means. To say “five feet four” (four inches) and “three seventy-five” (three dollars seventy-five cents) implies as much a form of representation as to say “The book is mine or his” (my book, his book), or “buy it at the grocer’s” (grocer’s shop), or “She went to her uncle’s” (uncle’s home). Following are some idiomatic omissions:—

Got up at six (o’clock) thirty.
In the year nineteen (hundred) thirty-seven.
He stands five feet six (inches).
It measures four (feet wide) by five (feet long).
The price is seven (dollars and) fifty-five (cents).
But what (am I) to do (or: say)?
I have heard (people) say that . . . .
Live and let (others) live.
Help (to) make it a success.
I help him (to get) over the stile, down the bridge, up the wall, out of a difficulty.
Her stepmother made her (to) sweep, scrub and clean.
I feel (I) like going out today.
He dare not (to) appear.
