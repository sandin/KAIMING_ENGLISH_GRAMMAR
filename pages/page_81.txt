AFFIRMATION BY A RETORT QUESTION 65

use of double negatives is often one of these reserved

5. a not too clean shirt (=dirty shirt)
6. none too kind (=rather unkind)
7. none too good for him (=rather bad for him)

(not without reason, with good reason). This use of double
negatives is sometimes quite expressive and useful, but is
after all rather roundabout, and may sometimes seem
affected or unnatural. For I ain't got nothing, see § 3.56.

3.46. Affirmation by a Retort Question.—This way of

pretty it is! This kind of question is really a kind of
exclamation. The word why, added to the beginning of a
sentence, is also only a means of emphasis, meaning of
