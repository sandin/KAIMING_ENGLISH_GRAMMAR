"SHALL" AND "WILL"

students. The clearest and simplest explanation is to
arrange them under the three heads: command, intention
and simple future.

SIMPLE FUTURE                     COMMAND
I shall          we shall          Always shall
you will         you will
he }                               INTENTION
she } will        they will        Always will
it }

As examples of COMMAND, we have: You shall be
punished for this / He shall be kept indoors / Each one shall
have two eggs for his breakfast / You shan't see her again. As
no one gives commands to himself, therefore the forms I
shall, we shall are not found in the sense of commands.
Instead of we shall, the form let's is used: Let's go.

As examples of INTENTION, we have: I will come
again / They will come tonight / He has decided that he will
not stay here any longer.

As examples of SIMPLE FUTURE, we have: I shall be
going soon / I shall be away tomorrow / You will be sorry for
this / The school will close soon / It will rain soon / Tomorrow
will be Saturday / It will be impossible to do anything tonight.

In asking questions, use the word which you expect
in the answer.

Shall you be here tonight?       I shall.
Will you come again?            I will.
Shall they come, too?           They shan't.
Shall I tell him?               Do. (You shall.)
Will he die?                   I'm afraid he will.
