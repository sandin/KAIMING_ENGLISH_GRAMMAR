WILL YOU? WON'T YOU?
69
(1) Knowest thou that I am the King of Persia?
(2) Do you know that the president has resigned?
(3) When did he resign? What president?
(4) So he has resigned, has he?
(5) He has resigned? (With rising tone at the end.)

The first type, so much used in Old English is now replaced by the modern second type. With the helping vbb. can, must, etc., we simply use can you? must I? etc. (i.e., according to Type One).

3.61. Will You? Won't You?—It is natural that we expect a negative answer with an affirmative question and an affirmative answer with a negative question. This is especially true of the negative question and it applies to all languages. In Chinese, 是不是 implies 是, and 豈有此理 implies 決無此理. But the actual usage of these negative questions varies with different languages. Thus won't you? is much more commonly used in English than in Chinese. We say Won't you sit down? in English as an invitation to sit down, whereas the Chinese 不坐一會嗎? is practically a gentle suggestion for the man to leave. Thus, it is quite common to hear expressions like Won't you have some cake? Won't you come with me? Won't you be so kind as to, etc.? Of course will you? is the usual form used in these sentences.
