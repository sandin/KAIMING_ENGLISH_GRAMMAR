CHAPTER XI
ASPECTS OF ACTION

11.01. The Study of the Verb.—The study of the vb.
and its changes has been often regarded as the most
important, and perhaps the most difficult, part of gram-
mar. It is true that the vb. is the most important word
in any sentence, because it is the vb. which gives life to
the whole sentence and connects the parts up in a logical
whole. Compare, for instance, She is picking roses in the
garden, which gives us a satisfactory mental picture, with
She roses in the garden, where the succession of images is
dead and unrelated.

Undoubtedly, also, the vb. undergoes more changes
and requires more careful handling than any other part
of speech (compare, for instance, the relative stability of
the n.). Just as an action has more complicated relations
than an object or a quality, so a vb. is subject to more
variations than a n. or an adj. An action immediately
presupposes some one who does it (the subject of the
action), and it may easily affect some one else or some
particular thing (the indirect or direct object). Then, an
action always takes place in time, whereas an object or
quality does not necessarily involve a time-notion. Final-
ly, the action itself may be of the most various kinds,
whether active or passive, continuous or completed, real
or supposed, etc.

In usual grammar books, the vbb. are divided into
three classes, transitive, intransitive and auxiliary; each
