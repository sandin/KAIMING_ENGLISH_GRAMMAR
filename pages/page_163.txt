EXPRESSIONS OF SHAPE
141

一架書櫥 i chia shu-ch'u (one “shelf” book-case)
一頭牛 i t'ou niu (one “head” ox)
一座山 i tsuo shan (one “seat” hill)
一把刀 i pa tao (one “grip” knife)
一管筆 i kuan pi (one “tube” brush)
一盞燈 i chan teng (one “small-cup” lamp)
一灣溪水 i wan ch'i-shui (one “curve” river)
一鉤新月 i kou hsin-yueh (one “hook” new moon)

There are times when this shape-notion is carried so far as to apply to abstract things even, as in the following:—

一門親事 i men ch'in shih (one “door” marriage)
一團晦氣 i t'uan huet-ch'i (one “lump” depressed spirit)
一腔熱誠 i ch'iang jeh-ch'eng (one “throat” enthusiasm)
一場惡夢 i ch'ang o meng (one “scene” bad dream)
一股勇氣 i ku yung-ch'i (one “bunch” courage)
一道命令 i tao ming-ling (one “path” official order)

This way of thinking, however, although not common in English, is not entirely absent in that language. When a chorus girl,* under the fire of the prosecutor's questions in a court trial, cries out in desperation: “Oh, won't you leave me one shred of my reputation?!” she is using there a phrase implying a very vivid shape-notion. Notice also the following:—

a cake of soap
a bar of soap
a ball of cotton yarn
a sheet of paper
a drop of water
a grain of sand, rice, justice

a piece of mutton, hair, paper, luck
a strip of land, cloth, paper
a ray of hope
a shower of criticism
a sea of trouble
an expanse of water
