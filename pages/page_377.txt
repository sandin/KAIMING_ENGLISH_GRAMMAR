IRREGULAR VERBS
355

therefore, called “irregular.” The irregularity is due to
historical development from earlier Indo-Germanic forms,
while a great number of regular vbb. today were original-
ly irregular. English vbb. from Latin or French sources
are always regular (return, commence, cease, remember),
while all irregular vbb. are original Germanic words
(with related forms in modern German, Dutch, Danish,
and Scandinavian).

For practical purposes, it is only necessary to study
these vbb. under three heads: (a) those having one form,
(b) those having two, and (c) those having three.

(a) Some vbb. do not change at all or have only one
form.
