Impersonal Subjects

12.50. Impersonal Subjects.—In English, there are a
great number of vbb. which can be used with impersonal
subjects, very much as we say in Chinese 事情發生, 東西
遺失. Unless one takes care to note this use, one might
easily make mistakes in the use of vbb. Thus we have:
“a dress becomes a person” (looks well on him or her),
“food does not agree with a person” (not: person agrees
with food), and “idea occurs to a man” (not: man occurs to
idea). The proper way to say 我遇見某事 is: “I came
across something” or “Something happened to me,” but
never “I happened to something.” Study the following
examples of vvb. with impersonal subjects:—

The door opens.
Shops open at 9.0 a.m. (not are opened)
The semester begins. (But: Work is begun.)
