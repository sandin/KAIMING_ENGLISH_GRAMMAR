102 PERSONS, THINGS AND THEIR GENDER

Some older authors, too, are fond of writing Knowledge, Hope, Despair, Humanity, Courage, Patience with capital letters, but this has become out-of-fashion in modern times.

More common and more useful are the following forms of personification. (b) The use of she and her in speaking of a nation or a ship. (c) The use of personal vbb. like know, regret, remember, agree with words like the world, the people, posterity, China’s womanhood as singular subjects. (d) The use of the personal possessive form (with ’s) in connexion with non-personal objects, as the clock’s hands, the river’s mouth instead of the hands of the clock, the mouth of the river or the river mouth, and the cloud’s colour instead of the colour of the cloud. This last form should generally be avoided, except in special phrases, as “China’s sorrow” (the Yellow River), out of harm’s way, for convenience’ sake (cf. for my sake), the day’s work, a good night’s sleep, at a minute’s (or moment’s) notice. The last examples are really convenient phrases made for economy of expression, like the whose discussed above, and have little suggestion of personification.

     2. Fortune smiled on him, and he became the most popular novelist of the day.
(b) 3. France was asking America to cancel her war debts.
     4. She (the ship) was going at 12 knots an hour.
(c) 5. The world shall long remember what the people lived through during the Great War.
     6. China’s womanhood is taking the matter very much in her own hands.
(d) 7. Mr. H— was lying at death’s door.
     8. Let us say, for argument’s sake, that he was cheated by others.
