IRREGULAR PLURALS
113

The plurals clothes, staves (piece of clothing, wooden strip
in a tub) have developed meanings different from the
singular. The change in pronunciation does not occur in
all words of the same endings. Thus we have:—
[-siz] in horses, cases, races, courses.
[-əs] in hearths [hɑːrθs], heaths, months, tenths.
[-fs] in roofs, proofs, chiefs, safes, strifes.

In truths and earths, usage still varies: both [ðz] and
[θs] are used.

5.21. Boys, Ladies, Pianos, Potatoes.—Nn. ending in
y and o are sometimes written with -ys, -os, and sometimes
-ies, -oes in their plural forms. There is a fairly good
rule for nn. in -y, but there is nothing but utter confusion
in the case of the nn. in -o, and the best advice is to look
up the dictionary whenever in doubt.

“-ys” [y after vowel]: boys, toys, days, trays. (also, pulleys,
whys).
“-ies” [y after consonant]: ladies, stories, kiddies, flies, duties,
armies.
“-os” [o after vowel]: bamboos, Hindoos, taboos, folios,
curios, embryos, portfolios.
[long words]: generalissimos, archipelagos, manifes-
tos, negritos.
[foreign-looking words]: pianos, solos, photos, grottos, flascos,
albinos.
[proper names]: Romeos, Galileos, Neros.
“-oes” [some familiar plurals]: potatoes, heroes, negroes, mosquitoes,
buffalo s.

English spelling is here unreasonable, as usual, but there
is nothing else to do except following the usage.
