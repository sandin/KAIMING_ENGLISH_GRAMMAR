11. It’s the only right thing to do.
12. Have the letter sent at once.

14. You can have everything you want now, money, freedom, a beautiful wife, a nice house and garden, dinners and parties, and vacation trips.
15. Be careful of wine and women.
16. He is giving up medicine and going to study law.

8.71. Generalization: “a Cat,” “the Cat,” “Cats.”—When we talk about things in general, we may use the plural without article or use a or the in the “generic singular” (§ 5.25). Thus—

(1) Englishmen are usually reserved in manners.
(2) An Englishman seldom talks to strangers.
(3) The Englishman is quite different from the Frenchman in his manners.

The third form refers to an abstract idea of “the Englishman,” and is not found in Chinese. Here the abstract “Englishman” is made to represent “all Englishmen.” Also—

(1) Cats are afraid of dogs.          (Indefinite pl.)
(2) A cat is afraid of a dog.         (Indefinite sing.)
(3) The cat is afraid of the dog.     (Abstract type)

I love a good liar really means the same thing as I love good liars.

Exercise 62. Study the following examples, and see if it is possible sometimes to change the generic singulars into generic (or indefinite) plurals and vice versa:—

1. According to the Christian prayer-book, the bridegroom promises to love and protect, and the bride promises to love and obey.
