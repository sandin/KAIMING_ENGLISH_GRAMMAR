SENTENCE MOODS

Are you never going to take a little vacation?—Not until I
finish this book of mine.
Let us start the bonfire now.—Not so soon. Wait till the guests
have all come.

Exercise 24. Make sentences with some of the phrases: not now,
not I, not so soon, not if, not that, not until.

The case of All that glitters is not gold is quite peculiar
to English. It really means Not all that glitters is gold.

Interrogation

3.60. Interrogation.—In our study of English affirma-
tive and negative sentences, we have learnt that the
question is often used as a form of emphatic assertion
or denial. It has also been shown (§ 3.50) that the forms
He came and Did he come? require some special practice.
Now there are five main types of questions: (1) by
simple inversion of word-order between vb. and subject,
(2) by addition of helping vbb., (3) by the use of interro-
gative pronn. or advv. (who, what, which, when, where, why
and how), (4) by the tag-question, and (5) by mere question-
ing tone without* change of word-order or interrogative
words.* In all except the last type, the verb-before-
subject word-order (or “inverted word-order”) is used.

*It would be foolish to force the students to remember these
five types as so many convenient pills to swallow. Grammar becomes
uninteresting the moment this spirit of learning formulas and dead
enumerations enters. It is much more important that the students
know how each form is used to express our ideas. No Englishman is
ever conscious of these five types. Nor is the knowledge of these
types of any use to him: the use consists in his ability to employ them
to express his living meaning.
