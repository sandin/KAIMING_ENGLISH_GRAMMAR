PREFACE

The Science of Expression

The Kaiming English Grammar represents the application of a new philosophy of grammar to the teaching of English grammar to Chinese students. It regards all grammatical forms and constructions as merely means of expressing notions, and grammar itself as a science of expression. Instead of starting from the outward form to the inner meaning, it starts from the inner meaning to the outward form, from the notions to the expression of these notions. Consequently, instead of concerning itself with the definitions and analysis of word-forms and formal changes, it goes deeper into the psychology of the speaker, and asks what are the notions back of the speaker's mind, which he is trying to express, and by what grammatical means he expresses them. Grammar therefore, concerns itself with (1) the notions, and (2) the expression of these notions. To these questions all grammatical changes and constructions are related and made subordinate. This emancipated view of grammar is made possible through the ideas of Benedetto Croce, and, more specifically, through the epoch-making works of Otto Jespersen (Philosophy of Grammar, 1924) and Ferdinand Brunot (La Pensée et la Langue, 1922).
