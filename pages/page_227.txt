WORD-CLASSES AND WORD-RANKS
205

there are no other problems about sentence structure,
because the subjects, principal vbb., objects and con-
junctions are usually easy to find out. We shall study in
this chapter, for instance, such common and important
constructions as the relative clause, the prepositional
phrase, the participial phrase, the infinitive phrase and
the complements of principal vbb. which are all some
form of modifiers.

9.11. Word-Classes and Word-Ranks.—In the phrase
exceptionally fine music, we say that fine modifies music,
and exceptionally modifies fine. Here we feel the n. music
to be the principal or chief word, and fine to be only a
word used to qualify or modify it; exceptionally, again, is
logically subordinate to fine. Hence, it is possible to
speak of “word-rank”: the modified word seems to stand
on a higher rank than its modifier. Similarly, we can
distinguish three ranks in the phrases: very (3) entertain-
ing (2) book (1), or quite (3) well (2) written (1), or rapidly
(3) rising (2) reputation (1). It will help us to under-
stand the relationships between modifiers and modified,
if we use the terms “higher rank,” “lower rank” (or
“subordinate”) and “equal rank” (or “co-ordinate”). Of
course, we can have more than three ranks: thus in the
following, each added word, except “a,” modifies the
modifier which stands after it—
