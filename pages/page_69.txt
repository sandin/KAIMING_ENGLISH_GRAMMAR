IMPORTANCE OF FINITE VERB
47

Danger ahead! (=Drive slowly.)
The idea! (=How can you, he, etc. think of such a thing?)

Since there are such colloquial expressions, we must say that a sentence is simply a complete and independent expression. Any complete and independent expression may be called a sentence.

3.11. Importance of Finite Verb.—The above cases, however, are exceptions. Generally, a sentence must have a verb in it. In answer to the question “What have you got there?”, the answer “A red rose” is quite complete. But usually, a red rose says nothing and cannot be called a sentence. Likewise, Soochow-Nanking is not a sentence, but only a group of words. I go from Soochow to Nanking is a sentence, because here the finite verb (2.30) gives life to the sentence and connects the parts into a whole.

We must remember to use a verb in every sentence, because this is an important English habit, and because Chinese students often forget it. Adjectives and participles (vbb. changed into adj.) alone cannot say anything. We can say He dies (vb.), but not He dead (adj.). We must say He is dead. Nor can we say The man playing in the garden as a sentence, but we must say The man is playing, etc.
