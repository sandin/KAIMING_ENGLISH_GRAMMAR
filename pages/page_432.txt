16.21. Change of Clauses into Phrases.—In consequence of the relative simplicity of nn. and complexity of finite vbb. (which entail with them a subject and perhaps an object), phrases which are without a vb. and subject are shorter and neater than clauses. This is especially true of prepositional phrases. The two words for fun can stand for he was not serious in, and the two words by necessity can take the place of the clause because he had to do it. Do it by turn is much shorter than You do it first and the others will do it one after another. During his absence is shorter than while he was away. In English, there are many pairs of prepp. and conjj. which have the same meaning.
