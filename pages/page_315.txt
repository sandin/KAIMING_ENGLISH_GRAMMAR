WHAT IS AN ASPECT? 293
transitive vb. may have two voices, active and passive;
each voice may have so many moods, like interrogative,
indicative, imperative and infinitive; the indicative and
interrogative moods again may have so many tenses,
present, past and future, and so many subordinate tenses,
like present simple, present perfect, present perfect con-
tinuous, etc.

In this book, which is based on notional principles,
the vb. will be studied mainly under four heads: (a) the
Aspects of Action (Chap. XI), (b) Transitive Action, es-
pecially the relationships of the subject and object (Chap.
XII), (c) the Time of Action (Chap. XIII), and (d) the
verbal moods, or Fact and Fancy (Chap. XIV). Thus, ex-
cept the relationships with subject and object, and the
notions and expressions of time and mood, all the other
changes will be covered under the term “Aspect.”

11.02. What is an Aspect?*—An “aspect” of action
means a class of action. Actions, naturally, may be
divided into different classes. Thus—

repeat, reiterate, return, recover, regain

*The word “aspect” is a term much used by grammarians in the
comparative study of Indo-European languages, but except in the
Slavic languages, where the word has a definite meaning, the term
has been used to denote the most different things. Grammarians
have not been able to agree, and it is not necessary to agree, how
many aspects should be distinguished and labelled in the ideal
language. This is because certain verbal aspects are recognized in
some languages and totally ignored in others. In the study of any
one particular language, however, it is entirely possible, and ex-
tremely necessary, to note the aspect-notions in that language.
