14.22. Different Degrees of Supposition.—Attention has already been called to the existence of several subjunctive forms (§ 3.77). In a simple sentence referring to the present, we could use the following forms:—

(1) If he comes
(2) If he come (if he should come, should he come)
(3) If he came

The question is, how should one distinguish them in actual use? In order to understand this, we should know that there are different degrees of supposition, from a supposition which may quite possibly be true (if he comes), to a purer form of supposition (if he should come) and even a supposition which is definitely untrue (if he came for the present, and if he had come for the past). Just what degree of supposition is used depends entirely on the intention of the speaker.

(1) Past suppositions are untrue. Past events are facts (see § 13.40). Hence whether a statement in the past tense is true or untrue is generally known, and an imagined or supposed event in the past is known to be untrue. This is easily seen in the following examples:

If it had rained last night, the roads would be wet. (It did not rain last night.)
