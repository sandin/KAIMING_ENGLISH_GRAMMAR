SENTENCE MOODS

do it means definitely that he can (a fact), but He could do
it means I suppose that he can do it, although he has not
done it. China is not strong, but China could be strong, if,
etc. You have not burnt down the whole house this time,
but you might have, so next time be more careful. All
these express pure suppositions and not facts. A supposi-
tion could, of course, be true. If I say “Mr. P— may
be sick,” I am stating it as a possible fact. But if I say
“Mr. P— might be sick, for I haven’t seen him for the
last few days,” I am stating a pure supposition of mine.
The difference between may and might, therefore, chiefly
depends, not on the facts of the situation, but on the
intention of the speaker.

This distinction between fact and fancy (see fuller
treatment in Chapter XIV) is very important to learn,
because there is nothing like it in Chinese grammar.
Many Chinese students fail to learn the use of such highly
idiomatic expressions as I should think, I should like, would
you? could you? etc. because they do not know the idea of
general supposition or pure supposition. And yet the
proper use of I should like, could you? etc. is one of the first
conditions of speaking good English. Simple people like
to make blunt statements of facts, whereas more educated
people are never too sure about what they do not quite
know. It is often more refined to say “It would be all
right” than to say “It is all right.” Could you come to my
house? is also more polite and gentle than Can you, etc.?
because it seems to say Could you come, if I should ask you?
as a matter of supposition. It is less direct than asking
Can you come or can you not? as a question of fact.
