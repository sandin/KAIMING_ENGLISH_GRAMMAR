POINT OF TIME AND PERIOD OF TIME
:23

(2) Keep —ing, etc.

keep going                      remain sitting
don't keep telling me that      remain living with him
keep on talking                 continue standing

We can say continue to talk or continue talking, but not keep to or remain to talk. The double advv. on and on are often used: He talked on and on / He ran on and on.

(3) Stop —ing: stop to. These two expressions have opposite meanings. You never stop to think means that you keep on going ahead and never think, while you never stop thinking means that you are thinking all the time. On the other hand, cease praying and cease to pray both mean the same thing, i.e., stop praying.

He did not even stop to take a drink.
A never stopped to look at a lady; B never stopped looking at ladies.
I have never stopped (ceased) loving you
Many people cease to study when they have ceased going to school.
H— has never ceased to believe in you.
Unless you two stop fighting, I will call in the police.

Durative and Punctual

11.60. Point of Time and Period of Time.—In point of duration, actions may be regarded as “punctual” (taking place at a point of time) or “durative” (extending over a period). Understanding of this aspect is very important for the proper use of vbb. The difference is illustrated in two sentences already given above:—

Husbands and wives have quarrelled (durative) since human marriage began (punctual). (§ 11.42, “3”)
