ment, nor is the system communicative, but really the
system of communication is meant. Below are some more
examples:—

air transport 航空運輸
temperance society 禁酒會
water problem 飲水問題
employment bureau 職業介紹所
arithmetic class 算術課
railway regulations 鐵道章程
trade mission 商業調查旅行團
peace conference 和平會議
war council 軍事會議

birthday party 壽宴
wedding march 結婚進行曲
swimming suit 游泳衣
bathing costume 浴裝
fishing-boat 漁船
washing-woman 洗衣婦
printing machine 印刷機
dancing party 跳舞會
dining-room 飯廳

It may be noticed here that a bathing costume does not refer
to a costume which bathes, but one used for bathing: thus
bathing is here originally a vb. turned into a n. and then
used as a modifier. Similarly, a fishing-boat is a boat used
for fishing purposes. (But a sailing-boat may mean a boat
which sails, and a printing machine may mean a machine
which prints as well as a boat for sailing and a machine
for printing.)

On the other hand, we must notice that the English
language has certain phrases which may seem logically
wrong, but are idiomatically recognized today. Thus a
dead march is the correct expression for a funeral march
(cf. wedding march), and a mad-doctor is the correct
expression for a doctor of brain diseases (cf. madman, mad
dog). These phrases are created for convenience. Again
Foreign Office is strictly Foreign Affairs Office or Office of
the Secretary for Foreign Affairs (who is also called
“Foreign Secretary,” but who is really not “foreign” at
all). Further examples are:—
