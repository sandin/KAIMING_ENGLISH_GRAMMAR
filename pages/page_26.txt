THE SCIENCE OF EXPRESSION

are three degrees of comparison, like hot, hotter, hottest /
early, earlier, earliest, because there are these three changes
in word-form. As a matter of fact, there are not only three,
but a thousand varying degrees, and as many ways of ex-
pressing them, like less hot, not so very hot, rather hot, just
hot enough, too hot, hot enough to burn your fingers, so hot
that you can hardly breathe, as hot as a furnace, etc. All
these expressions are as much a part of English grammar
as the expressions hot, hotter, hottest. Again, among the
notions of number, there is the Chinese notion of ch'eng (成)
or tenths and there is the English notion of percentage: the
correct English expression for pa-ch'eng-wu (八成五) is
simply eighty-five per cent. If we thus proceed from one
group of notions to another, we shall soon learn all the
important English forms of expression for the chief kinds
of ideas and relationships.*

We shall thus study many things that are not found
in the old-style grammar books. And in the study of the
changes in form, like It rains, It rained, It has rained, It
has been raining, etc., which are found in the old-style
grammars, we shall study them not as empty forms to be
repeated and memorized, but as means of expressing some
ideas which we have in our mind.

*Of course we cannot study all the expressions in the language,
which is the work of the dictionary. The difference between a book
of grammar and a dictionary or book of phrases is that grammar deals
with only the types or classes of expressions, and the dictionary deals
with particular expressions. According to Sweet, grammar deals
with the general facts of language, lexicology with special facts.
