FACT AND FANCY

If I had not stopped him, he would have been killed. (I did stop him.)

(2) Future suppositions are uncertain. Future actions or events have not yet taken place, and therefore future statements seldom state a fact, but a wish (I will go), an obligation (I have to go), a possibility (I may go), or an expectation (I shall go). In any case, there is almost always a strong subjective element (see § 13.30). The subjunctive form (if it rains tomorrow: also general tense-form, if it should rain tomorrow) always implies an uncertainty.

(3) Present suppositions vary. The most common form used is the ordinary indicative: if he comes. When a greater degree of supposition is meant, the general tense-form if he should come (now) is used. This may be called a purer form of supposition. If he come (instead of if he should come) is used with still greater subjective effect, as in arguments: even if he come / though he be a millionaire / provided he obey strictly my orders. A more direct and still purer form of supposition is if he came, or even if he came, which almost always implies that the supposition is untrue.

Exercise 111. Decide which form should be used in the following sentences, and examine the degree of supposition involved, whether it is possible, supposed, or untrue. Notice that the ordinary indicative is very often used for the present.

1. What if I don't (didn't?) want to help you?
2. What does it matter, even if it is (was?) true?
3. I will have that treasure searched for, even if it cost (should cost? costs?) me a hundred thousand dollars.
4. What can (could?) he do, even if you refuse (refused?) him?
