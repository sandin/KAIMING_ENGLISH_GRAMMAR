Tentative Action

11.80. Tentative Action.—This aspect is known in
Chinese, but never employed to the same extent as in
English. The usual form is try to, with the emphatic
forms attempt to and make an effort to. Thus a phrase like
tried to capture the city is very difficult to translate exactly
into Chinese. It may or may not be implied in the phrase
來攻某城 (攻下與否未曾明言), while 試攻某城 is simply not
Chinese. The Chinese language provides clearly only
for the successful or conclusive aspect: 攻下. Thus try to
persuade and persuade may be translated by 勸 and 勸動了.
But how shall one translate such phrases as try to work
hard, try to do your best?

Notice also the English expressions tend to and be
inclined to:—The movies tend to encourage crime / He is
inclined to be lazy. These also express the non-conclusive
aspect, and are also difficult to translate idiomatically.

On the other hand, we have another form of tentative
action expressed in Chinese as represented by 嘗一嘗, 試
一試, 打一打, 敲一敲, 碰一碰, 走一走, 問一問. This may
properly be called the casual aspect, implying that the
action is done casually, without any serious purpose. 跟
他講一講, 說一說 means try to persuade him, and if he
won’t listen, then give up. In English, the nearest
approach to this aspect is seen in take a look (看一看),
