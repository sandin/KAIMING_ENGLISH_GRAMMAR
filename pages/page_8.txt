a series of systematic drills on classes of expressions
which every speaker must employ. No sane advocate of
the reading-without-grammar method would deny that
the value of such reading lies really in picking up turns
of expression in living contexts, and that by arranging
these turns of expression in notional classes and provid-

can be made much easier and more pleasant. There is no
gainsaying the fact that coming across a lone expression
here and there and finding its parallels after long intervals
is less effective and less convincing than having that
lone example immediately reinforced by a dozen other
examples of the same class and construction. Put in this
way, there can be no argument against grammar.

The Bugaboo of Rules

I should have mentioned a third cause of grammatical
mistakes, that due to efforts at “correctness” and fear of
breaking grammatical rules. This fear can be carried so
far as to override all natural idioms. The poor boy who
begins to say “Whom are you?” after having learnt
grammar at a night-school, or the Ziegfeld Follies girl
who says “between you and I” with some sort of conscious
pride is really only labouring under a confusion of mind
engendered by the subtle rules of grammar. Even among
foreign students, this type of grammar with so many
“don’ts” and “shall-nots” is more likely to make the
school-boy feel he is treading treacherous ground in a
room full of traps and secret doors rather than using plain
English to express his ideas. Such abominations as “if
