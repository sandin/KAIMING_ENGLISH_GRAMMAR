Other adjj. which do not admit of comparison both in Chinese and English, do not require special caution. One dead body, for instance, cannot be deader than the rest, nor can one piece of ice be more frozen than another.

The latter construction, therefore, does not admit of a direct translation, but has to be paraphrased. Similarly—
