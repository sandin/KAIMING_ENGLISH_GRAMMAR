Moreover, determination is only one form of modification:
this, a determinative word in this book, modifies the word

Thus we may distinguish three functions:—
(1) Representation: to take the place of other words (Chap. VII).
(2) Determination: to answer the question “Which one?” (Chap.
VIII).
(3) Modification: to modify or describe the meaning of other
words (Chap. IX).

They are three classes of notions that we have to study,
but one and the same word may serve two or three differ-

pronn. are classified in the following way:—
(1) Personal: I, you, it (also possessive forms my, mine, your,

(3) Relative: “the man who escaped,” “the girl that he loves,”
etc. (relating to a preceding word).
(4) Interrogative: who? which? what? (used for asking ques-

It will be seen that the possessive pronn. my, your and
the demonstrative pronn. this, that chiefly serve the
purpose of determination. The relative pronn. serve as
often to determine which one as for other purposes of
modification, thus:—
