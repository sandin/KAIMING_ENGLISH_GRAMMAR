ACTION AND CONDITION
297

today (present indefinite) does not, in the English way of thinking, seem to accord with the truth. The use of I stay and I do not see seems to indicate only an action lasting a short moment. I am staying (pres. continuous) at that hotel not only at this moment, but also this morning and this evening. And if I do not wish to see any visitors today, I am not seeing (pres. continuous) them not only at this moment, but also in the morning and in the afternoon.

The present indefinite is, therefore, used chiefly in three connexions. First, to suggest habitual action: as Do you play tennis? / He smokes. Secondly, in general statements: as The earth moves / The moon waxes and wanes / The results depend on your own effort / The balloon goes up by its own weight or lightness / It pays to advertise / As soon as the vessel is filled, it topples over. In all these examples, really no present action is indicated. Thirdly, where the vb. itself is sufficient to indicate a long duration. Many vbb. are of this nature: know, feel, realize, think, understand, fear, hate, love, like, live, be, remain, etc. E.g., He knows (feels, sees, realizes) his mistake / I think you ought to go / I understand what you mean / I fear you are wrong / I hate to go alone / He intends to come back / You forget that you owe him a debt of gratitude / Where do you live? / That is a mistake / That remains to be proved.

Notice that the passive voice invariably indicates a condition and not an action as such: He is killed / The watch is lost / The jar is broken / I am told / You are not allowed / He is greatly respected, etc.
