A phrase may be a prepositional phrase (beginning
with a prep., as in the garden, by his family), an infini-
tive phrase (“to” followed by a vb., as to see it, to be seen),
a participial phrase (beginning with a participle, as cross-
ing the street, singing a song), or any combination of
words that does not contain a finite vb. For instance, we

the important phrases and clauses used as modifiers (the infinitive,
prepositional and participial phrases and the relative clause) will be
studied in the important chapter on Modification (Ch. IX)
