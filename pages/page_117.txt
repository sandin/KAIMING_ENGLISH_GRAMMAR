Common and Proper Nouns

4.40. Common and Proper Nouns.—The most common
classification of nn. is the division into common nn. and
proper nn. Examples of proper nn. are Ningpo, Mencius,
Chinese, Arnold Bennett, and examples of common nn. are
book, table, story, city. According to some grammars, a
proper n. is defined as the name of one particular person
or thing, and a common n. is defined as that of a whole
class of persons or things. Any table may be called a
table and any city may be called a city, whereas only one
city is called Ningpo and only one man was called Men-
cius. This distinction is practically useful, but we should
know that it is really impossible to draw a sharp line
between the two. May not any negro be called a negro?
Is the word negro a common or proper noun? Certainly
the word Chinese can be applied to a whole class of persons,
and certainly there are many Lins in China. And yet
Chinese and Lin are considered proper nn. And if Chinese
is considered a proper name, why is the yellow race con-
sidered a common noun? Are the moon, the sun and the
earth common nouns or proper nouns? And if summer
and winter (spelt with small letters) are considered common
nn., because there are many summers and many winters,
why are January, February and Monday, Tuesday written
with capital letters at the beginning like proper nn.?

The distinction between common and proper nn. is
only a relative one. The proper n. is felt to be more
exact, more specific and more artificial, while the common
