8.72. Special Uses of “A” and “The”.—There are some special uses of “a” and “the” which must be mentioned here.

(1) In regard to pronunciation, a is pronounced [ei] when accented or stressed, but otherwise and generally [ə]. The is pronounced [ði:] only when accented or stressed, otherwise [ðə] before following consonants, and [ði] before vowels. As Chinese students of English often make a mistake in pronouncing these two words generally with accent or stress when they should be unaccented, it is very important for them to learn to pronounce them correctly.
