314 ASPECTS OF ACTION

This form, called the “perfect tense,” therefore be-
longs to the conclusive aspect (indicating completed
action) and does not primarily refer to time. We could
have the same aspect either in the present (I have eaten),
in the past (I had eaten) or in the future (I shall have
eaten). It is much clearer to separate the two notions of
time and aspect, instead of confusing them under the
notion of “tense,” which is really time and aspect com-
bined.

The Chinese particle liao (了, unstressed [lə]) exactly
indicates this conclusive aspect, and not the past time
merely. 下雨了 means that it is raining now, that it has
begun to rain, and not that it rained. 快要下雨了 means
that we have already reached the condition now that rain
is falling soon (present condition as a result of possible
future action). Compare also 米快要完了, which means
that rice is running out now, that we haven’t got much
rice left. 事不成了, 事糟了 (The plan is doomed to failure /
The thing has been spoilt) also indicate the conclusive aspect.

11.41. Present Perfect and Adv. of Time.—Because of
this fact that the present perfect indicates a present con-
dition, we cannot, according to the English usage, use it
with advv. denoting past time, although we know very
well that the action took place in the past. One cannot
say I have come back yesterday. The action, it is true, took
place in the past (therefore one can say I came back yester-
day), but we are speaking of the present condition (there-
fore one should say I have come back now).

Exercise 85. It is most easy to make such mistakes by inserting
an adv. denoting some past time when the action really took place.
