§33 SUBJECT AND OBJECT

matical difference is that an intransitive vb. requires a
prep. to enable it to be connected with any object, while a
transitive vb. does not.

12.31. Direct and Indirect Objects.—A v.t. may have
two objects at the same time. In I give you a knife, knife
is called the direct object, and you the indirect object. It
really means “I give the knife to you.” The person to
whom or for whom a thing is done is said to be the indirect
object. Thus an indirect object is really an object with a
hidden prep. (to or for). According to English idiom,
we usually drop the prep., whenever possible, and place
the indirect object before the direct object. Buy me a new
hat is more idiomatic than Buy a new hat for me. Study
the following:—

Will you do me a favour? (Not: “Will you do a favour for me?”)
Send him the story. (Not: “Send the story to him.”)
Wish me good luck. (Not: “Wish good luck to, or for, me.”)
Pay him the money. (Not: “Pay the money to him.”)
You do me a great honour. (Not: “You do a great honour to me.”)
Save me the trouble. (Not: “Save the trouble for me.”)
Save him some money. (Not: “Save some money for him.”)
Spare me that agony. (Not: “Spare that agony from me.”)
Show him the picture. (Not: “Show the picture to him.”)
Teach him a lesson. Kiss him good-night.
Give him a warning. Call me a taxi.

The forms in brackets are not ungrammatical, and are
sometimes used, but are not really idiomatic. Notice that
both forms are used in Chinese: 送我一本書, 給他十塊錢,
報告你一個消息, and 送一本書給我, 拿十塊錢給他, 給你報告
一個消息.

With some vbb., we can attach a prep. either to the
indirect or to the direct object. We may say I present
