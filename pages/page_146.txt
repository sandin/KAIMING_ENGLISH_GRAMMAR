of number; thus a meeting of “over one wan people” in
Chinese is really the equivalent of a meeting of “fifteen
hundred people” or so in English.

The expressions fifteen hundred or seventeen hundred
fifty (for 1,500 or 1,750) are quite common for figures
below two thousand. The year “1930” should therefore be
read as nineteen (hundred) thirty, which is better than the
clumsy one thousand nine hundred thirty.

For ordinals (first, second, etc.), see § 8.50.
