6.60. Expressions of Position. — Position is usually
indicated in English by prepp. and advv., as well as by
adjj. It should be remembered, however, that the re-
lationship between prepp. and advv. is very close and the

[Adj.] He is in.
[Adv.] He goes in.
[Prep.] He is in the house.

There are few prepp. that cannot otherwise serve as adjj.

above your head       man above              stay above
below him             man below              look below
under the water       under-log              go under (sink)
between them          a layer between        came between
over the top          meeting is over        talk it over
about this point      is about to            turn about

In up train, man below (above), we may regard the words
up and below as originally advv. used as adjj, like then in
the then (reigning) king. We say also “His visits home
are few and far between”: the advv. home and between are
