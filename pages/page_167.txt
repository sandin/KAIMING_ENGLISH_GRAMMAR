PECULIAR USE OF PREPOSITIONS
145

a good dictionary. Study, for example, the following
phrases, and notice the change of meaning and the
entirely arbitrary nature in the use of prepp.

The use of up and down in connexion with travelling
is quite like Chinese. We say up north, but down south,
and use up in general for going to a higher place, or
capital, or university, and down for the opposite. The
word around is gradually disappearing in British usage,
and is being substituted by round. While Americans
would say turn around, go around to the post, the church
around the corner, loaf around a place, such expressions are
already impossibilities for an Englishman. He would
say round here, round the corner, seated round the table,
stationed round the field.

Notions of concrete position naturally shade off into
those of abstract relationships. For prepp. expressing
relationships (angry with person, at thing), see Chap. XV.
