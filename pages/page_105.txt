THE SUBJUNCTIVE CLAUSE
83

What will you do now? (What are you going to do?)—A question of fact.
What would you do, (if you were in my place)?—A supposition.
Can you do it? (Are you able to do it)?—A fact.
Could you do it, (if I should ask you)?—A supposition.
Suppose you put water over the fire, what would happen? Would the fire get wet?
Suppose you put oil into the fire, what would happen? You might burn down the whole house, might you not?
Look out! you may fall down. Answer: But I don’t (fall down).
Reply: But you might.
I should like to see you try. (I suppose I like.)
I should think he feels rather ashamed of it.
Would you have tea or coffee? What would you rather have, tea or coffee? (Gentle question.)
Why don’t you do it? Answer: I suppose I could do it, but I don’t want to.
Will you help him? He is short of money. Answer: I would if I could (but the fact is, I can’t).
You should help him if you could. And I believe you could if you would. (You will not, that’s why you say you can’t).

3.77. The Subjunctive Clause.—We often use the word if to express a condition, as if it rains, if he comes, etc. Just as there is a difference between can you come? and could you come?, so there is a difference between if he comes and if he should come.

Tell him to wait if he comes. (It is quite possible that he will come.)
Tell him I am not at home, if he should come. (He seldom comes, and I don’t wish to see him.)
If he is there, tell him to come at once. (He may be there.)
If he should be there again, bring him to me. (He has been there once, and I have told him not to go there again, but if he should do so, bring him to me.)
If I am elected, send me a telegram.
If I were (should be) you, I would resign at once.
