It is impossible to draw up any rule as to which kinds of vbb. may take impersonal subjects and which kinds may not. One should merely form the habit of noting whether a certain vb. is used with impersonal subjects or not. The only rule is to consult a dictionary, when in doubt. A certain Chinese student once wrote The men were full of house (for 人滿屋, really The house was full of people), because he had neglected to learn sentences as a whole and to observe the use of an impersonal subject in the case of the phrase e full.
