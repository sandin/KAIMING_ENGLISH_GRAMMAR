SUBJECT AND OBJECT

It is wrong to tell a lie.
It is true that I dislike him.

These mean the same thing as—

To tell a lie is wrong.
That I dislike him is true.

The form with it as the grammatical subject is used because it is much more convenient to dispose of the short predicate first and then state the long subject afterwards. It seems as if we were to say It is wrong and then, in answer to the question “What is it?” say: to tell a lie. To tell a lie is, therefore, said to be “in apposition” to the subject it. In It is true that I dislike him, the subject it may be considered as the “antecedent” of the relative clause that I dislike him. (See § 7.45 for further examples.)

(b) It is also often used without any clear meaning, but merely to satisfy the English grammatical requirement for a subject, as in It rains / It was winter / It is never too late to mend. We really do not know, and do not care to know, what is never too late to mend, or what was winter.

12.22. “There is.”—The peculiar construction there is corresponds to the Chinese yu (有): There is a boy (=有一小孩). In such sentences, we are forced to assume that the n. following there is is the subject: thus in There is a boy, boy is the subject, and is the vb. Really it does not mean quite the same thing as A boy is ther. Phonetically, there in there is, there are is always pronounced without stress or accent: [ðə] ([ðə'rɪz], and [ðə'rɑː] or [ðərə]). This is especially clear in the sentence—

There is a boy there.
