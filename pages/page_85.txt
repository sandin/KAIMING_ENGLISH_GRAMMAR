3.52. No, Not a, Not Any, Nothing, etc.—We generally say There is no one, but There is not any one, and I have no money, but I cannot pay. No is thus used as an adj. before nn., and not is used as an adv. When there is a noun, it is better to use no. It is better to say There is no one than to say There is not any one. The form with no is often more emphatic. Thus That is no easy task is more emphatic than That is not an easy task. In this way, we get the common expressions, no good, no fun, no use.

The pen is no good.          It is no use talking (or to talk).
That's no fun.               Talking is no use.
This camera is no use.       It's no go (=nothing can be done).

This Camera is no use is more expressive than This camera is not of any use. Some careful writers like to say This camera is of no use, but they never say That's of no fun. Instead of saying I do not know anything, or I do not know anybody, we can say, of course, I know nothing, or I know nobody. It is shorter and easier.

Exercise 22. Use no, nobody, nothing, none in the following sentences and change them in any way you like:—

1. I have not received any answer from him.
2. I have not seen any Chinese in this city.
