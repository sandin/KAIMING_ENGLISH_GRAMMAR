APPOSITION AND EXAMPLE
187

Then we three, Kuo-fang, Min-cheng and I, started together.
They tried to catch us, Kuo-fang, Min-cheng and me (myself).

In the last two examples in the first part of this
section (There are many kinds of diseases, etc.), the words
in apposition are really examples or instances (cholera,
typhoid, diphtheria) of the word they modify (diseases).
Such examples are usually introduced by the phrases:—

such as                    as follows
for example (“e.g.”)       that is (“i.e.”)
for instance               namely (“viz.”)

As follows is always used to mean as what follows. We
never say as follow, even when many things follow.

Exercise 58. (I) Words in apposition are used for general
purposes of modification as well as for determination. Point out the
appositive words in the following and tell whether they are used
only for determination or for other purposes of modification.

1. The Chinese Emperor, a mere boy of seven years old, had to
abdic ate the throne.
2. He, a father of grown-up daughters, was still running round
with all sorts of women.
3. Edison, the famous inventor, is a friend of Henry Ford, the
automobile king.
4. Herbert Hoover, the President of the United States, was an
official mining engineer of the Manchu Government in his
early days.
5. Your cousin Mary is engaged to be married.
6. Tom, the piper’s son, stole a pig.
