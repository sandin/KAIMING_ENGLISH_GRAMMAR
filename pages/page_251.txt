Exercise 71. Translate these into Chinese and then back into English again. This may be done by yourself in the form of writing, or with the help of the teacher or some other students giving the Chinese equivalents. Then make sentences with these material, or form new phrases with the following as the words to be modified: no chance, no time, no opportunity, ability, desire, nothing, something.

(b) When we say try to see him, the infinitive phrase to see him obviously helps to complete the meaning of the principal vb. try. Inasmuch as the infinitive here completes the meaning of the principal vb., it may be called a complement of that vb. As it comes directly within the predicate itself and modifies the principal vb., it may be also called a predicate modifier of the vb. The English language abounds with such idiomatic expressions, and they include not only vbb. in the active voice, but also vbb. in the passive voice and adjj.
