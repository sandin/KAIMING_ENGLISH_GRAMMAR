20 PARTS OF SPEECH & CHANGE OF FUNCTION

2.17. Sense of Aspect and Manner.—The sense of manner (情狀) which is expressed by adverbs is not new to Chinese. The Chinese expressions with jan practically always express the same adverbial function. Thus we have 茫然 (vaguely, in a lost state), 孑然 (alone), 漠然 (coldly), 欣然 (glad, gladly), 霍然 (suddenly), 寂然 (silently), 哑然 (with a roar of laughter), 悚然, 凛然 (with a feeling of awe), etc. But the sense of aspect (方面) is rather new: it is now expressed in modern Chinese with the particles 上 and 的. For instance, we speak of the inequality of the sexes, but we may ask in what respect are they unequal, physically, mentally, legally, or economically? This is now expressed in Chinese by 體力上, 智力上, 法律上, 經濟上的不平等. We can also think of a person as physically and spiritually unclean (心邪形穢), and of a girl as attractive in appearance and intelligent in mind (秀外慧中). If a child’s father is a great scholar but ugly-looking, while his mother is a silly pretty-looking doll, it makes a great difference in what respect the child resembles his father or mother. He may resemble his father in his brains and his mother in his looks, or he may be like the father in looks and like the mother in brains. Adverbs and adverbial phrases of aspect answer the question: in what regard? in regard to what? or in what way? This notion of aspect is quite important, because it makes our ideas more exact (Adjectives may also express the same aspect-notion.)

You want to be independent—how? Financially or spiritually?
In what respect are men and women unequal? Physically, mentally, socially, legally, or economically? Are they equal in brains, in looks, in courage, in patience, in jealousy, in interest, in babies?
