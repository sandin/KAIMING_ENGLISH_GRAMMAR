3.42. Affirmative Replies.—We generally use “yes”
in affirmative answers. But it is often desirable to make
better answers than the blunt “yes.” Every language
has various ways of expressing agreement, and politeness
requires that we say something more than a mere “yes”
when answering to any request. Following are some ex-
amples:—
May I see this book? ...........................Certainly. Of course.
Can I have a cigarette? .........................Why, certainly.
May I smoke here? ..............................Please do.
Could you let me talk with you for a
moment? ........................................With pleasure.
Shall I shut the door? ...........................If you please.
So I have to take care of her? .................Quite so.
Am I to hand in the exercises tomorrow? .....Exactly.
