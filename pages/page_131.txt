MASS-WORDS

with. When we want to count it, or express the number,
we can say a grain of rice, a piece of hair, three grains of
sand. These may be called countable mass-words.

Then, we have the mass-words that really cannot be
counted, but can only be measured by measures of quan-
tity. Sometimes, we can count the drops of rain and
drops of water, but nobody can count the drops of water
in a basin or a river. We can, however, measure water,
as we can also measure the countable mass-words such as
sand, fruit and rice. Thus we can say a bushel of rice or
sand, and a pint of water. The following expressions of
quantity are useful:—

One pint (about two tumblerfuls) = 品脫 (流質量名,約二玻璃杯額).
One gallon (8 pints) = 咖喻 (八品脫).
A picul = 擔,石. A bushel = 斗.
Three inches of snowfall or rain fall = 雪積三(英)寸,雨量三(英)寸之高.
One ampère (electric current or flow) = 安培.
One volt (electro-motive force or strength: a 100-volt current can-
not make a 220-volt lamp bright enough, because the force or
strength is not sufficient) = 伏特.
One watt (electro-motive power as measured by work done: a 220-
volt bulb means a bulb suitable for an electric force of 220
volts, but a 70-watt bulb means a bulb that can give so much
light, about 100 candle-powers. Thus bulbs in the same city
generally must have the same voltage, but may have different
degrees of lighting power) = 瓦,瓦特.
Thirty-two candle power(s) (speaking of lights) = 三十二支光 (燭力).
Fifteen horse-power(s) = 十五馬力 (h.p.) (one h.p. = the power to lift
550 pounds a foot high during a second).
