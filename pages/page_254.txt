MODIFICATION

The infinitive can be in the active or passive voice, and
can be in the perfect or imperfect tense:—

    Active.     A house to let. (Owner has house to let.)
    Passive.    A house to be let. (House is to be let.)
    Perfect.    He seems to have read a great many books.
    Imperfect.  He seems to be working all the time.

Now, with regard to the modifiers of the infinitive, when
we put a modifier between to and the vb., we have what is
usually called a split infinitive.

    To come quickly. (Normal.)
    To quickly come. (Split Infinitive.)

There are many “non-splitters” among the grammarians
who absolutely will not countenance a split infinitive,
like to quickly come. But there are just as many people,
and among them good writers, who take care to consciously
and deliberately flaunt the rule. The plain truth is,
however, that the only determining factors should be:
clearness of meaning and the natural rhythm of the lan-
guage. Usually, a split infinitive breaks the natural
rhythm of the sentence, as in—

    Tell him to quickly come ↘

But—

    Tell him quickly to come.

is just as bad, because the rhythm is not better, and the
meaning is not clear (ambiguous): quickly may as well be
taken to modify tell as to modify come. The only clear
and natural way is to say—

    Tell him to come quickly.
