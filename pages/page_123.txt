101

Exercise 37. Substitute whose for of which, of whom in the following sentences:—

1. The detective picked up a small, square box, the cover of which was made of fine wrought-silver, and the inside of which bore the initials “B. W. H.”

2. I was introduced to a man the name of whom was familiar to me.

3. The cripple was made the referee of the games the rules of which he was entirely ignorant of.

4. We then entered the old castle the walls of which were moss-grown and covered with ivy.

5. I received a letter the handwriting of which looked like that of my dead brother.

6. I got a book the corner of the cover of which was slightly damaged.

4.63. Personification.—Personification, or considering an animal or a thing as a person, is of various kinds and is more common than we suspect. (a) When Laotse says “Heaven-and-earth is unkind: it (he?) treats the creation like dummy-dogs. The sage is unkind: he treats the people like dummy-dogs” (i.e., dummies made of hay used for the sacrifices) (天地不仁, 以萬物為芻狗. 聖人不仁, 以百姓為芻狗), he is there personifying heaven-and-earth, regarding it as capable of being kind or unkind, like the sage himself. The English people, too, often personify Nature, Heaven, Fate, the Furies, Fortune, Justice, Liberty, etc. Some of these examples go back to Greek tradition, and the English people often actually have the image of a goddess in their minds, when they speak of Justice or Liberty. That it should be a goddess rather than a god may seem strange to Chinese minds.*

* Compare, however, Laotse, 有名萬物之母, “The Named is the mother (and not father) of all things.”
