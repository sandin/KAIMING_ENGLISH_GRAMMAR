MODIFICATION

friends, good luck, stubborn fellow thus form single concepts modified by the adj. The cases under “C” are really felt as compound modifiers, consisting of two adj. Thus red modifies hot, snowy modifies white, and ashy modifies pale, but at the same time we feel that red also directly modifies the hot object, which looks red, and snowy also directly modifies the white substance. In the same way a window which is described as wide open is not only widely open, but is also wide because it is open: wide, therefore, directly modifies the window as well as open. A “bitter-sweet experience” is an experience that is both sweet and bitter; it is therefore different from a “bitter cold night” which means a night bitterly cold. Dark red, deep blue and light green are felt as compound adj.

(c) Adj. or Adv. + Participle.

new-laid eggs, or newly laid eggs
new-born baby, or newly born baby
new-coined words, or newly coined words
newly-married couples
green-painted houses, but thoroughly re-painted car
smoky-looking walls
good-mannered people, or well-mannered people
moderate-sized building, or moderately sized building
foreign-built house
deep dug-in trenches
plain-spoken man

Just as in the case of red-hot iron, we retain the adj. form red because it partly modifies iron itself, so also in the case of new-laid eggs, it is possible to say new, because we are partly thinking of new eggs. In these cases, we can say new when we feel that it modifies eggs, and say newly when we intend it to modify the participle laid. Hence
