SENTENCE MOODS
already been studied in the preceding sections (Affirmation, Negation and Interrogation). It is also not meant that these potential sentences are not affirmative or negative sentences. But actually there is this class of sentences which must be studied. The distinction between what is true and what may be true is quite important, and the student should avoid stating as actual fact what is only a wish or a possibility. These sentences are called “potential” in this book, because they all express what may happen or what is possible. Sometimes a Chinese student says I hope you come. He makes this mistake because he has not learnt that the form You come expresses a real act, while what he hopes for is only You will come, i.e., a potential fact.
3.71. Command, Request, Suggestion, etc.—Sometimes we wish somebody to do something. This may not always be a command; it may be a humble request, a friendly advice, or a pious wish. Of course, the simplest form is the direct command, as Go and fetch water! This is always addressed to the hearer, and the word you is generally, although not always, omitted. We add the you especially when there are several persons receiving the order, as You wash the floor, and you (pointing to another) clean the window. When the persons commanded are still more numerous or different, we generally use shall, should, is to, etc. Thus, The third-year boys are to come in first and take the front rows, the second-year boys shall march in when the bell rings and the first-year boys will follow after them. When the speaker himself is involved, the usual form is let us (let’s), as Let’s have a game, or more gently, Let’s have a game, shall we?
