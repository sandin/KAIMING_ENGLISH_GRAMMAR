3. On the one hand, he could not do it himself, on the other,
he tried to prevent others from doing it.

15.63. The Colon.—The colon is usually used when
one or more examples of what has just been said are about
to follow. It is also used when one statement repeats
another statement in a different form.

He said: “You have won.”
The list is as follows: one hat, two canes, three pairs of boots,
etc.
Columbus discovered a string of islands: he did not discover
the American Continent.

15.64. The Full Stop.—The full stop marks a com-
plete sentence. There is a tendency in American jour-
nalism to make short snappy sentences, with full stops
marking parts of sentences, which should not be imitated.

“There is a tendency in modern newspapers to use short
snappy sentences. The shorter the better. For the snappier
they are, the happier the reader will be. Which is a good
thing for the busy business-man.”

The full stop is also used whenever there is an abbrevia-
tion of any sort. Examples are: Dr. (Doctor), Mr.
(Mister), C.P. (Communist Party), Dec. (December),
R.C.A. (Radio Corporation of America), yrs. (yours).

15.65. The Exclamation and Question Marks.—Although
the use of these marks is a matter of commonsense, a
warning should be given that mistakes are often made in
their employment.
