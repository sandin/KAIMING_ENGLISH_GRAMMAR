AREN'T, ISN'T, MUSTN'T, ETC. 61

AFFIRMATION NEGATION
I come (go, play). I do not come (go, play).
I came (went, played). I did not come (go, play).
He comes (goes, plays). He does not come (go, play).

PRESENT PAST
(A) He comes (A) He came.
(B) Does he come? (B) Did he come?
(C) He does not come. (C) He did not come.

Notice also that we say (1) He need not come, He dare not come, but (2) He needs to come, He dares to come, and (3) Dare (Need) he come? or Does he dare (need) to come?

Exercise 20. Practise the following orally, until you can do it naturally and without mistake. Vary the sentences according to the three forms ‘A,’ “B,” and “C”:—

3. He heard the shot.
4. You spoke to that fellow on the way.
5. They all ran away when the police came.
6. The teacher saw me, but did not see him. (The teacher did not — me, but — him).
