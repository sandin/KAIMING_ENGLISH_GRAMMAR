THE POOR, THE DEAD, ETC. 87

10. He is so generous that he is famous for it.
11. What we want is that we should all be united.

2.41. The Poor, the Dead, etc.—The English language has a way of using expressions like the poor, the rich, the strong, the oppressed to denote a class of things or persons. This also saves us the trouble of stating exactly what the objects are, and this way of stating a whole class is likely to be more accurate. When we say the oppressed, we mean all that are oppressed, whether they are farmers, rickshaw coolies, small shop-keepers, or newspaper editors. Some examples of these expressions are:—

The living and the dead.           The oppressors and the oppressed.
The rich and the poor.              Turn to the right, to the left.
The false and the true.             A search for the unknown.
The righteous and the wicked.       The young ought to be housed and fed.
The meek and the humble.            None but the brave deserve the fair.
The lame, the halt and the blind.   You are trying the impossible.
The modifiers and the modified.

These expressions mean the same thing as those that are poor, those that are living, etc., and are very convenient to use. The same ideas are often expressed with the help of the word one, as the young ones, the fat ones, etc. They correspond to the Chinese notion of 者 in 强者, 弱者, 贫者, 富者, 生者, 死者, etc.

Sometimes, some adj. are used as nn. without any change, as Chinese for the Chinese language or the Chinese people. You are a dear is more expressive than You are dear. I may also mention the unmentionables by which some English ladies mean trousers. Other instances are:—

eatables [食物]                   sweets [糖食]
drinkables [飲料]                 the French [法人]
valuables [貴重物品]              the English [英人]
