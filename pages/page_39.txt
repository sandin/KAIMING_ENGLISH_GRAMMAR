SENSE OF THING
17
Through the following exercises, the student will learn to
feel the difference between nouns, verbs, adjectives, ad-
verbs, and prepositions. The other three parts of speech,
pronouns, conjunctions and exclamations are easy to
recognize and are not so very different from the Chinese.
When these are learnt, the student will find it easy to
recognize the part of speech of any word he hears or reads.

2.15. Sense of Thing.—A concrete thing, like table or
chair, is regarded as a n. either in English or in Chinese.
But actions (人事), invisible qualities (品性), and con-
ditions (情况) regarded as nn. have peculiar forms which
are strange to the Chinese mind. Study the following, and
see how the nn. of action and the nn. of quality or condi-
tion are used exactly like other nn.
