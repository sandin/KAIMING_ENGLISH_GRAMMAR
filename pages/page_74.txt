SENTENCE MOODS

hope, wish, promise, etc. It is hard to say exactly how many sentence moods there are: they vary as much as our moods or feelings vary. But, for the sake of convenience, we may say there are the following five main kinds: (1) Affirmation, (2) Negation, (3) Interrogation, (4) the Potential Moods (of command, wish, promise, etc.), and (5) Emotional Utterances (or exclamations). The study of these sentence moods teaches us, (1) how to state a fact, (2) how to deny, (3) how to ask questions, (4) how to express a wish, a supposition or anything that may or may not be fact, and (5) how to make exclamations in English under the stress of emotion.

3.31. Chinese and English Compared: Chinese Modal Particles.—A foreigner studying the Chinese language would have also to study the various Chinese sentence moods. He would find that the Chinese largely use modal particles (or particles expressing a mood, a kind of “empty words” or “form-words” 虛字, as against “substance-words” 實字) to express the different sentence moods, which are expressed in English largely by the verbs. Thus we use ma (嗎) to express the questioning mood, ni (呢) to express the question of unbelief, refutation, or disagreement, la (了) to express the sense of completion, pa (罷, 吧) to express final decision or command, etc. These particles always come at the end of the sentence. Sometimes these moods are expressed by conjj. or advv. in the beginning or middle of the sentence, as nan tao (難道) for expressing disbelief, chueh (卻) for expressing admission, liao-hsiang (料想) or tsung (總) for expressing a supposition or conjecture, etc
