You and I are out of danger now.
I and he were on the same train.

(3) There is another source of trouble from such
constructions as some of us, some of you, etc. Here com-
monsense may be trusted to decide on the right word to
use. Study the following:—

Some of us think they (not we) can fight without my leadership.
(Not including speaker.)
Some of us think we (not they) can conquer by passive resistance.
(Induding speaker.)
Some of you believe they can make more money that way.
Most of us lost our heads (if including speaker), or Most of us lost
their heads (if the speaker thinks he is an exception).

(4) But our troubles do not end here. We have the
relative pron. who. Who always agrees with its related
preceding word (“antecedent”) in person and number.
Study the following:—

Don’t choose me, who am already burdened with too much work.
It is not you who are in trouble, it is I who am in trouble.
I am not one who is (not am) afraid of criticism.
I am not one who cares.
You are the one who was (not were) elected.
