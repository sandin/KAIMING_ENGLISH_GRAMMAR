COMPARISON AND DEGREE

The use of so . . . as (followed by a word or phrase) and
so . . . that (followed by a clause) is quite common. They
both express a degree of quality defined by the following
phrase or clause, quite similar in function to the word teh
(得) in 熱得疼手, 熱得頭昏, etc.

Exercise 88. (A) Translate the following into Chinese:—
1. so hot as to burn your fingers
2. so hot that one can scarcely breathe
3. so soon as I can come
4. so bright as to dazzle your eyes
5. so big that two can sit in it
6. so excited that he forgot his appointment
7. so fat that she could not climb the stairs
8. so quiet that you could hear a pin fall
9. so happy about it that she cried

(B) Translate the following into English, using so . . . that, or
so . . . as, to describe a degree:—
1. 我疲得不能走路。                    5. 這機器熱得燙手。
2. 我熱得不能喘氣。                    6. 他急得要哭出來。
3. 那天熱得瓶中金魚都死了。            7. 他窮得沒錢買米。
4. 日光亮得不能開眼。                  8. 他窮得不能付每月房租。

(3) Not enough, etc. Cases like not hot enough and
not as hot as differ from the examples given under “2”
only in having not added. The prefix under- is some-
times used to express the idea of insufficiency.

writer has been underrated or underestimated (not rated or re-
garded as high as he deserves)

what is required)

and sex)
