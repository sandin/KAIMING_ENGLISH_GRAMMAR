MODIFICATION

a rainy and stormy weather
a careful and efficient worker
a tedious and long speech
a small but comfortable room
a very clever, but rather erratic (unsteady) chap
a brilliant, but thoroughly impracticable scheme

a mediocre, but serviceable book of reference
after a dangerous, though exciting adventure
a homely but clean-looking face
a glorious, though defeated fighter
making slow but sure progress
progressing slowly but surely

In certain phrases, these modifiers seem to merge with one another in meaning and in a way really modify one another. This is especially clear in phrases beginning with nice and, as nice and clean, nice and cool, nice and warm, nice and soft. Here nice and really acts as a kind of adv. modifier for the following adj. Thus, “The car is going nice and fast” means that it is going fast in a nice way, or satisfactorily fast, and “The house stands nice and high” really means that it stands high enough to satisfy you.* In the same way we have “high and dry talk” (=abstract talk) and “high and mighty manner (=proud, arrogant manner).

These co-ordinate modifiers are often used to reinforce one another’s meaning, as in the above example of that stingy, dirty, little black backyard, where it seems the speaker can never condemn it enough, but must pile up more and more adjectives. In such cases, we practically never employ any conjunction, but just pile them up for accumulating effect. Some interesting examples are:—
I saw a great, big tiger.
He was a tall, big, husky fellow.

* Here the use of and is really similar to its use in “Be a good boy and get out of my presence,” which means, “Be so good as to get out of my presence.”
