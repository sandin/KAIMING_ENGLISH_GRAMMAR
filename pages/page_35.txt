(4) Adjectives modify nouns.
They tell what people or things are like. Both in a sick man and The man is sick, the word sick modifies man, and shows what the man is like.

(5) Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.
Adverbs generally tell how, when, where or why a thing is done. Thus in He is running fast, He is running now, He is running there, the adverbs fast, now, there modify the verb is running. In very red and very soon, the adverb very modifies the adjective red and the adverb soon respectively.

(6) Prepositions with the nouns following them form prepositional phrases which modify other words. The preposition itself always shows some kind of relation.
There is no preposition which is not followed by a noun or its equivalent, or which does not form a prepositional phrase. In He is in the house, we have the prepositional phrase in the house, with the preposition in. But in He is in (meaning “in the house”), the word in is regarded as an adjective, because it does not have the prepositional function. In the house is a phrase modifying he. In He talks like mad (like a mad man), the prepositional phrase like mad modifies the verb talks. All prepositional phrases are used either as adjectival or adverbial phrases.

(7) Conjunctions join words or groups of words.
In he and I, this or that, the words and, or are conjunctions. In You may come this way or that way / You may come or you may go / I will not come until you go away, the words or, until join groups of words.
