INDETERMINATION
201

You may come whenever you like (please).
The kingfisher flies away whenever it sees a man.

The words whatever, whoever, however, whenever,
wherever require some special notice. The last three are
easy and are used as special forms of the conjunctive
adv. how, when and where, introducing clauses. Thus—

How he tried.
When he remembers.
Where he went.

However he tried.
Whenever he remembers.
Wherever he went.

Whatever, whoever, too, can be used as special forms of
what (=no matter what) and who (=no matter who). The
only peculiar thing to notice here is that we often have
apparently two vbb. to these words. Thus in—

(What I have) is yours,
(Whatever I have) is yours,

it is quite clear that what(ever) I have is the subject of is.
Hence we have such constructions as—

(What is left) is quite worthless.
(Whatever is left) is taken away.

Similarly, who and whoever are used as in the following:—

(Who steals my purse) steals trash.
(Who breaks) pays.
(Whoever said this) is a liar.
(Whoever kills the enemy captain) shall have my daughter
for his wife.

It would be wrong to say—

Whoever said this, he is a liar.
Whoever kills the enemy chief, he shall marry my daughter.

Compare also §7.31 “c” for the use of whoever and
whomever and for further examples.
