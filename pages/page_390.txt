TIME OF ACTION

We sat up last night till (or until) one o'clock. We did not go to
bed till (or until) one o'clock.
We will keep on (will not change) until the proper time comes.
No one will be able to know the truth until the wounded man
returns to consciousness.
Until you told me I had no idea of it.

(2) No sooner than, as soon as, directly, the moment.

No sooner had he finished his last sentence than the audience
stood up. As soon as he finished, etc.
No sooner did I save up a few hundred dollars than some of my
relatives fell sick or died. As soon as I saved up, etc.
The moment you leave the office, everybody starts talking,
smoking and doing anything but attending to his duties.
Directly (or: As soon as) you leave, etc.
Immediately he went away, some burglars went into his house
and stole many things.
There will be a great sensation, immediately (or: directly or as
soon as) this news is spread abroad.

(3) While and when. Notice that we just as often
attach while or when to the second clause as to the first in
an English sentence. We were talking together when he
entered the room is probably more idiomatic than When we
were talking together, he entered the room. (cf. Chinese 我們在
講話之時他進來, but not 我們講話在他進來之時). In any
case, a when- or while-clause often stands at the end of an
English sentence, while it seldom does so in Chinese. The
English proverb says, “Make hay while the sun shines,”
and not “While the sun shines, make hay.” When is often
used like which for adding comments (§ 9.62).

You may just as well finish this up while you are waiting (or:
while you have nothing else to do).
I have no time to do any reading until I come back from office,
when I am usually too tired. (Comment)
