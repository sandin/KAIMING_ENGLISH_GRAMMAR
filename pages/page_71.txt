3.22. Sentence Structure: Modifiers and Conjunctions.—
We have seen that the important parts in a sentence are the
subject, the principal vb., and sometimes also the object.
This is clear and easy to remember. All sentences are
made up this way, no matter how long they are. They
are sometimes very long because we add words or groups
of words to modify the subject, the vb. or the object,
and join these groups by conjunctions. So we can classify
all parts of a sentence into these five kinds: (1) subject,
(2) principal verb, (3) object, (4) modifiers, and (5)
conjunctions. The sentence—
“The dirty boy plucked a beautiful red rose in your garden this
morning, and was caught.”
may be analyzed as follows:—
Subject—boy.
First verb—plucked.
Second verb—was caught.
Object of 1st verb—rose.
Modifier of subject—the, dirty.
Modifier of 1st verb—in your garden, this morning.
Modifier of object—a, beautiful, red.
Conj. joining the 2 vbb.—and.
