CHAPTER IX
MODIFICATION

9.10. Modification: Its Importance.—We have mentioned in our discussion on sentence structure (§3.22) that a sentence, no matter how long and complicated, really consists of some of the five parts: (1) subject, (2) principal vb., (3) object, (4) modifiers (including prepositional phrases), and (5) conjunctions. Without the modifiers and conjunctions, we should all be speaking short, bald sentences like these—

Flood came.
Mother died, father disappeared — son sat — door-step — wept.
Student was punished — stole books — proctor saw — dismissed — school — was beaten — father — became robber — became emperor — China.

Thus we should not be able to say where and when the flood came, and whether it was a big flood, a small flood, a terrible flood, or a flood that lasted only three hours—or whether it was a flood of water, or a flood of news, or a flood of tears, or a flood of words. Examine also the following sentence and see what an important part is played by the modifying words, phrases and clauses in italics (phrases and clauses are in brackets):—

(All of a sudden) and (without any warning) the terrible flood came, (a foaming, furious, thundering torrent), (that destroyed houses, streets and whole villages), (drowning men, women, children, cats, dogs and cattle) and (turning the whole region into a lake, dotted here and there with tree-tops and house-roofs with men and women on them like drowned monkeys).
