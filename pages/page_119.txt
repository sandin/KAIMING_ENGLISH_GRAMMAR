Collectives and Mass-Words

4.50. Collectives or Group-Names.—There are a class
of nn. which denote a group of things or persons taken
together, and which may be called collectives or collective
nn. Collective nn. may be considered as singular (one
group) or as plural (many individuals). Thus, we may
say the Government have or has . . . / There is or are a flock
of sheep / The whole staff resign or resigns. For some collec-
tives we have no proper Chinese equivalent, as the crew of
a ship (船中機師水手之總稱), the faculty of a department
(一系之全體教員), the staff of a company (全體職員). We
also speak of a person’s hair (meaning all the pieces of his
hair) and the shot (meaning all the little lead balls
discharged at one shot of the gun). Other examples are:
people, nation, troop, army, clergy, family, clan, society,
library, cattle, sheep, fish. For the grammatical number of
these words, see § 5.22.

4.51. Mass-Words.*—The words air, copper, wood,
alcohol, milk, etc. form a class by themselves. They can
never be counted, for they are neither singular nor plural.

*The term “mass-word” was first proposed by Jespersen, and is
a convenient distinction from the collective with which it has
usually been confused. According to Jespersen, the essential dif-
ference is that collectives are both singular and plural, while mass-
words are neither singular nor plural. The Jespersenian classifica-
tion seems to be made with reference to number. In this book,
however, I do not use this term to include abstract nouns (“imma-
terial mass-words”) such as health and happiness, because health and
happiness have no “mass” to speak of, and because number is not the
sole basis of classification here.
