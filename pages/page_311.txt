common form used in offering advice. It indicates a
course of action in preference to some other course.
Prefer is also often used for indicating choice between
two things or courses of action (prefer something more
desirable to, and not than, something less desirable).
Some examples follow:—

You’d better run along.
You’d better find out what he is doing.
He preferred the English to the French.

He prefers water to wine.
