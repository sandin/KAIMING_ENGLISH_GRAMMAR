we have a more abstract meaning, we use the singular
(§ 4.30), otherwise, we use the plural. Thus we may
say “Their heads (腦袋) look alike,” but “They don’t use
their head” (abstract singular = 用頭腦, 用腦力). Also, in
regular phrases, we usually keep the singular, as “They
came on foot (by walking),” “They took a fancy to her.”
Thus:—

They have no use (abstract).
The uses (separate) of the different parts.
The soldiers appeared in uniform (phrase).
The men appeared in formal dress (phrase).
The women wore bright-coloured dresses (some in green, some in
lavender, etc.).
The life (abstract) of the peasants.
The lives (separate) of great men.
Those three had also a hand (abstract, = a share) in the matter.
We must wash our faces (or even face, regarding “washing face”
as a regular phrase). But: We must tell them this to save
our face (abstract, = honour, good name [面子]).
All of them are in trouble (phrase). But: All of them are in
troubles of some sort or other (separate).
The foreigners can leave our internal wars alone; they need
not put their foot in it (= they need not interfere; not feet,
them).
This happened right under the nose (not noses) of the authorities.
We must keep an eye on that young girl (= watch her and keep
her from going wrong).
Opium-smokers always have a bad digestion.
People who want to preserve our “old morality” generally have
a bad conscience.
People who oppose the emancipation of women generally lead
an immoral life (or immoral lives, = have concubines, seduce
young girls, etc).
Men of bad temper, strong determination, good health, poetic im-
agination (all abstract words).
Words of different gender, number, meaning, case, etc.
