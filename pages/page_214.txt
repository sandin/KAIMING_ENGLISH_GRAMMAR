DETERMINATION

On the other hand, definite abstract nn. or mass-words
may have the article the, as the water you drink, the know-
ledge of the students, the milk in the coffee, the health of the
family.

“An” is used instead of “a” before words beginning
with the vowels, a, e, i, o, u, except when these vowels are
pronounced really with a consonant, w or y, at the begin-
ning. Thus the “long u” is really [j+u:] and so requires
a instead of an. Examples are:—

a university [,jn(ɪ)niˈvɜːs(i)ti]     such a one [wʌn]
a useful servant                      a one-hour class
a united policy                       a once popular writer

Some people still write an historian, because h in the
unaccented syllable his- is weakened so that the word is
pronounced almost like an istorian. Also: an historical
play, an heroic act [(h)isˈtɔrikəl; (h)iˈrouik]. But today
many people do not do this; they use a even before h in
unaccented syllables.

Exercise 61. Point out in the following why a or the is used, or
why both are omitted. Is the meaning definite or indefinite, singular
or plural, or neither singular nor plural (with abstract words which
cannot be counted)?

1. A letter was received from Hongkong, but, as it was
unsigned, nobody knows who was the writer of the letter.
2. There was a Jones in the same college.
3. A man named Bailey called this morning, but finding you
not at home, he walked all over the house.
4. Jackson is one of the best students in physics, if not the best.
5. A Mrs. Watson was at the witness box.
6. That’s a lie!
7. Liars must have a good memory.
8. Beggars must not be choosers.
9. They are talking like a pair of lovers.
10. That’s the girl!
