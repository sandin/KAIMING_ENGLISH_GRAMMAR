TIME AND LOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS

15.49. Time and Logical Relationships.—We have conjj. and advv. expressing time relationships like as soon as, meanwhile, after, introducing regular clauses. The usual advv. of this category, are, of course, when, while and as. It is found, however, that all such connecting words signifying time often develop a new meaning, which expresses another logical relationship besides time. Thus in the sentence—

Why do you try to help others, when you cannot even pay your tailor’s bills?

the relationship expressed is not one of time merely, but of a contrasting aspect. Similarly, with while and so long as:—“Why doesn’t he pay up his debt, while he is buying his wife new hats everyday?” / “So long as they don’t see each other, they get along nicely; but the moment they come together, they start quarrelling all over again.”

At the same time, in the meanwhile, in the meantime, meanwhile and while express contemporaneous action, often with contrasting effect. Pending with the same sense, is a prep. As soon as, the moment, directly, immediately and after, expressing a sequence of events, often imply an inner relationship of cause and effect also. The adv. once is particularly often used to express a causal relationship.
