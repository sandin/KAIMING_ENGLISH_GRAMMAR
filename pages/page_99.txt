HOPE AND WISH

once (= 給我滾蛋). Here you will implies I know you are going to (do as I say), and that I will not be disobeyed. Also, Englishmen often use I'll instead of I shall in many places because of economy of expression, as I'll (really I shall) not be able to go.

3.73. Hope and Wish.—In English, there is a slight distinction between hope and wish. Generally, we hope for what may or will happen, but wish for something which is quite untrue, but which might or could be true. Thus hope is usually followed by will, may, can, while wish is followed by were, could, would or by a vb. in the subjunctive past.

I hope you will come.
I hope you will be satisfied.
I hope they can agree with us.
I wish I were dead, (but I am alive).
I wish I could help you, (but I can't).
I wish you would not talk like that.
Do you know who sent the letter? — I wish I knew (i.e., I don't know).
I wish you could see him fighting against the whole bunch of them.
I hope it isn't true.
I wish it were true, (but it is not).
