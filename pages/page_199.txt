REPRESENTATION BY OMISSION
177

(1) The avoiding of repetition is one of the common causes for omission or suppression of words. Thus—

The upper (shelf) and the lower shelf.
His old (associates) and new associates.
Good-bye to the old year and welcome to the new (year)!
Cut off the first and last parts of the play, and leave the middle (part of the play).
I told you to come at nine o’clock, and you come at eleven (o’clock).
He can (do it) and will do it.
I can do it, but dare not (do so).
He could not do it, and would not (do it) if he could (do it):
He has inherited and (has) spent his fortune.
A new government had been established and (had been) overthrown in the course of the three days.
He was jeered, (was) hooted, (was) made fun of, and (was) dragged off from the stage.
I know you and (I know) him.
He brought his wife and (he brought his) children.
He lost his wife, (his) three children and (his) property.
His wife is taller than he (is tall).
You love her more than (you love) me.

In strictly correct English, one should not let one helping vb. represent by omission another which is not exactly the same. We can say “He had fought and (had) been defeated,” but we should not say “He was defeated and they (were) victorious.” Because were is different from was, it should be expressed and not omitted.

Exercise 56. (I) Repetition is not grammatically wrong, and is sometimes very expressive, but see if you can avoid the repetition of words, when you want to.

1. He gave him five dollars and gave me only three dollars.
2. This is seven o’clock, and you said it was eight o’clock.
3. We have searched the house and have found nothing.
