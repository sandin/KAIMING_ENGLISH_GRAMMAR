It is quite clear that in both cases, both of the hyphenated members are taken as a whole to modify the following word. Thus nine-headed bird really means nine-headed bird (=a bird with nine heads) and not nine headed-birds. Headed-bird would make just as little sense as raising stunts or curdling story. In the second group formed with vbb., we have under (a) vbb. + their objects, (b) vbb. + their logical subjects, and (c) vbb. with complements.

(a) hair-raising stunts = stunts that raise your hair.
(b) frost-bitten flowers = flowers bitten by frost.
(c) smoky-looking room = a room that looks smoky.

Because the room looks smoky, and the well is sunken deep (smoky modifying room, and deep modifying well), we do not say “smokily-looking room” or “deeply sunken well.”

Exercise 70. (A) Try to turn all the above phrase-modifiers into phrases or clauses following the modified words.

1. A crook with a double face.
2. A chair with three legs.
3. A house with five rooms.
4. A boy with a round face.
5. My brother who uses his left hand more than his right hand.
