100 PERSONS, THINGS AND THEIR GENDER

(11) Substitute who (whom) and which in the following sentences for that:—

1. The man that says this is a liar.
2. Those that are afraid need not come.
3. I like fried fish that looks brown and crisp.
4. I like a girl that dresses neatly.
5. A wife may fail you, but a good cigarette (is one that) never fails.
6. Your friends may fail you, but a good wife (is one that) never fails.
7. The man that fishes is called a fisherman.
8. The line and hook that the fisherman uses is called a fishing-line.
9. A rubber is the thing that is used to rub off pencil marks. It means sometimes a person that does the rubbing.
10. A robber is one that robs, and a thief is one that steals.
11. The person that you see sitting next to Mr. Y— is my cousin.

4.62. “Whose” and “Of Which.”—Like who and which, whose is generally used for persons and of which for things. Some writers would never allow whose to be used for other objects than persons. But this restriction is neither a help to clearness or convenience, nor historically correct.* The use of of which often requires a very troublesome, unclear and unpleasant construction, as This is a place the people, customs and geographical position of which I know nothing about. Certainly it is clearer and easier to say This is a country whose people, customs and geographical position I know nothing about. The first form is grammatically correct, but stylistically somewhat objectionable. We should say, therefore, that at least both forms may be used.
