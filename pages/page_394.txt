14.10. The Verbal Moods: Close Relation to Sentence Moods.—The usual classification of verbal moods is as follows:—

(1) Indicative: I come / I shall come.
(2) Imperative: Come!
(3) Interrogative: Will you come?
(4) Subjunctive: If he come.
(5) Infinitive: To come.

The indicative mood is used for making statements, the imperative is used for giving commands, the interrogative for asking questions, the subjunctive for stating suppositions, and the infinitive for stating actions without any particular subjects.

These verbal moods are but certain forms in the employment of vbb. They do not conflict with the “sentence moods” studied in Chapter III, but help to form them. The interrogative mood is naturally used in forming an interrogative sentence, and the imperative mood is used in sentences which are commands, etc.
