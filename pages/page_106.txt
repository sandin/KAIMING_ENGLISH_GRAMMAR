SENTENCE MOODS

So much, then, depends on what the speaker means, whether he considers it as a possible fact or as a pure supposition. The forms, if...is, if...comes, etc., are thus used for more likely suppositions, while the form if...should is used for more theoretical suppositions. There are, besides, the forms if he come (not comes), if you be (not are) in which the verbs are said to be in the subjunctive mood; their meaning is the same as if he should come, if you should be. And then, when a supposition is known to be untrue, we even use the past form of the verb, as if I knew, if I were (i.e., I don't know and I am not). We have, then, the following:—

1. If he comes.
2. If he come.
3. If he should come.
4. Should he come.
5. If he came.

If I am.
If I be.
If I should be.
Should I be.
If I were.

The forms “2” to “4” are really identical in meaning. For a more detailed study of the changes in vbb. (if he had come, etc.), see Chapters XIII and XIV.

It is peculiar to English that we could use the if-clause at the end of a sentence. Up till a few years ago when we started this “Europeanized Chinese” (語體歐化) business, we could not do so in a Chinese sentence. Now we can say, for instance, 此人野心很大, 倘是我的推料不錯 (“This man has great personal ambition, if I am not mistaken in my judgment”). This comes with the colloquial style. The if-clause comes as an after-thought; it is more easy and familiar and more like our thinking, because we often do not think of the if-clause until the end of the statement.
