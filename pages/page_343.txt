PARTICIPLES AND THE CONCLUSIVE ASPECT 321
done already. If a man “is killed,” then he is already
killed “If a jar is broken, it is broken already, or if a
watch is lost, it is already lost. Expressions of non-con-
clusive passive voice are comparatively rare, like A man
is being killed, A picture is being shown at the theatre.

Hence it is that the past participle (used in the pas-
sive voice) implies completed action (conclusive aspect)
while the present participle (used in the progressive
tense) implies incomplete action (non-conclusive aspect).
(There is, of course, the further difference that the present
participle indicates the active aspect, while the past par-
ticiple the passive aspect.) Thus by boiling water, we
mean water which is still boiling, while by boiled water,
we mean water which has been boiled. A returning traveller
is still on his way, while a returned student has already
returned to his home country. Contrast also the growing
boy and the grown-up man. (See § 2.33.)

In order to express the non-conclusive aspect with the
passive voice, we have to use the word being: the officer be-
ing elected, the course being decided upon. Hence we have
the following scheme:—

Conclusive Non-Conclusive
Active having elected electing
Passive elected (or having been elected) being elected
