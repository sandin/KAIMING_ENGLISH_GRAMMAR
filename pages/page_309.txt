The patient steadily grew worse.
He was daily becoming weaker and weaker, and was compelled to
take bigger and bigger doses of sleeping powder.
He found it more and more difficult (or increasingly difficult) to

account), or so much the worse.

worse on that account, as an added evidence of his guilt.)
A long delayed home letter is all the more welcome (=on account
of the long delay.)
