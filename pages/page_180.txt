REPRESENTATION

2. You are the man who break (breaks?) his promise.
3. Are you he who were (was?) here some time ago?
4. Either he or you is (are?) wrong. (change in any way you like.)
5. I hear you and he are (is?) good friends.
6. You who . . . so strong — you ought to be ashamed of yourself beating him who . . . a mere child.

7.31. Conflict of Case: “Who” and “Whom.”—Here are three types of cases to be discussed: (a) the it-is-I type, (b) the use of who and whom, and (c) the use of whoever, whomever.

(1) In “It is I,” “It is he,” the pron. I and he are not the objects of is in meaning. Hence the use of the nominative case. So also—

It was not I.
Then who (not whom) is it?
If anybody is to be punished, it should be he (not him).
Is this she (not her) whom I am going to marry?

(2) Who : whom. The use of the relative pron. who or whom has nothing to do with its antecedent, but depends entirely on its relation inside the who-clause (marked off in p entheses).

He deserted me (who gave him his chance in life). [Subj. of gave]
His mother is the person (who loves him best). [She loves him best]
His mother is the person (whom he loves best). [He loves her best]
Don’t argue with me (who am trying to help you). [Subj. of am]

We have to use different words when the cases are different, as in the following:—

His name is Alfonso, who is their king and whom they are trying to overthrow.
Hackett was her husband, who often maltreated her, and whom she hated like poison.
