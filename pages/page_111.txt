Process and Result

4.20. Process and Result.—In a phrase like the building of a building, or the painting of a painting, the first word building or painting denotes a process, while the second denotes the result of that process. The one implies a sense of action or motion, the other implies no such sense of motion. Compare the Chinese 他所畫的畫 and 佩帶 (=君子所佩, “what a gentleman carries,” i.e., jade, girdle, sword, etc.). There are many such distinctions in the English vocabulary, and one should make sure whether the noun denotes a process or action, or whether it denotes merely a thing, condition or quality (which may or may not be the result of the process). Compare the following:—

ACTION                      NOT ACTION (things, qualities
                            and conditions)

wedding day...............his marriage (result)
heating...................heat
allowing..................allowance (=money allowed)
immunization..............immunity from disease
differentiation, distinction.difference
presentation..............present (=thing presented)
identification............identity of person
