POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS AND NOUNS
185

(c) For ~’s sake:
for goodness’ sake
for peace’ sake
for convenience’ sake
for conscience’ sake
(But, for brevity’s sake,
for argument’s sake)

(d) Compound nouns:
the Duke of York’s brother
the Queen of Sheba’s beauty

Schwab & Son’s
Governor of New York’s statement
Emperor of Japan’s cousin
Government of India’s position

(e) Nouns in apposition:
Philip the Great’s son
Henry the Tailor’s bills.
My brother Yujen’s book
William the Second’s death

In (b) we read [siz] for s’s. Where the word already ends
in s-s sounds (Ulysses, Moses, Jesus), it is best to omit the
additional s just as in things’, birds’ (not things’s, birds’s).
The examples in (c), for … sake, may be considered special
cases; the apostrophe s is omitted because s’s before sake
would not sound nice. The examples in (d) are compound
names, and those in (e) contain two nn. which refer to the
same person (“in apposition”). Of course we do not say
my brother’s Yujen’s wife.

The expressions of yours, of mine, of my father’s have
already been mentioned in § 7.21. They are quite pecu-
liar and idiomatic English constructions. Examples of
their use are:—

He was a very dear friend of her uncle’s.
It was a great idea of his that China could be saved through rural
education.
It was a fond hobby of my father’s to collect curios.
It is a fond dream of mine to visit Spain.
Those fingernails of yours are a disgrace.
Look at that nice son of yours.
Take home these paintings of his and tell me what you think of
them.

Notice that in all these examples, either something
familiar or something we are fond of is expressed. That
