256 ASPECTS OF ACTION
denotes an action as such, am recovering and have recovered
denote, not an action, but a condition.

Chinese students continuously confuse the two aspects,
and employ the action-aspect far too often, where really
the condition-aspect should be used. Thus one often
hears such remarks as You play with fire, which is highly
un-English. The idea is to indicate the condition that
you are playing with fire. Such mistakes are extremely
common.

He comes here. (Say is coming)
You make a great mistake. (Say you are making, or have made)
He deceives you. (Say he is deceiving, or has deceived)
I consider this question now. (This is an impossible sentence:
say I will consider or am considering)
You fool me. (Say you are fooling)
The child plays alone in the room upstairs. (Say is playing)
I do not smoke this week. (Say I am not smoking this week)
I do not see anybody today. (Say I am not seeing)
I stay at the Y.P.S. Hotel. (Say I am staying)
I must go. (Say I must be going)
He gets better now. (Say he is getting)
He suffers from a headache. (Say he is suffering)

One may question why the fact that I must be going
should be expressed as a condition and not as an action.
But it is exactly this peculiarity in English ways of
thinking that should be noted. To a very large extent,
the present continuous has supplanted, or is supplanting,
the present indefinite, whose use is being gradually
limited. The fact is, an action often covers a long period
of time, so that the action becomes a condition, for which
the continuous or the perfect is more suitable. Hence a
sentence like I stay at Y.P.S. Hotel or I do not see anybody
