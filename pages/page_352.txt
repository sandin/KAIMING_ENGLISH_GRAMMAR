Miscellaneous Minor Aspects

11.90. Causative, Reiterative, Reflexive and Reciprocal.—There are a number of other minor aspects.

(a) Causative action. This involves two forms: either we cause a person to do something, or we cause something to be done: either We have the shoemaker repair the shoes, or We have the shoes repaired by the shoemaker. Both forms have already been fully examined in § 9.91.

(b) Reiterative action. In English, this is sometimes expressed through the prefix re-, as in reiterate, repeat, rebuild, readdress, reconvert, reconsider, reassemble, reorganize, revalue, re-enter, reopen. This prefix re- is a living one in English, as it can be attached to any vb. with the senses once more, again, repeatedly, and back to some former state. Sometimes the reiteration is expressed by the adv. phrases again and again, over and over again, as in He asked the question again and again.

(c) Reflexive and reciprocal action. An action may have direct bearing on the doer (subject) himself (Save yourself that trouble), in which case it is called “reflexive”; or if there are two or more subjects, the action may have a mutual bearing (Tell one another stories), in which case it is called “reciprocal.” The expression of these two aspects has already been studied in § 7.23 (“Reflexive and Reciprocal Pronouns”).
