Difference between “very” and “much.” Very is usually used with adj. (very ill, very good, very interesting); while much is usually used with past participles (much pleased, much influenced, much improved, much destroyed, or very much pleased, etc.). Much is also used with the comparative degree (much better, much greater, much more difficult). But there is a class of past participles which are so much used that they have practically become adj. Thus we can say I feel very tired, but never I feel much tired (cf. a very tired look on his face). The difficulty is that usage varies extremely in this respect and the line of distinction between the past participles that can be used as adj. and those that cannot is very difficult to draw. Unless one is sure that very is correct, much should be used before past participles. Very (besides much) may be safely used with pleased, delighted, surprised, worried and frightened when these words are not followed by by. In the latter case, they are really used as past participles in that particular connexion. When in doubt, greatly may be substituted.

On the other hand, adj. which can be used only predicatively (after the nn.) and never attributively (before the nn.) generally go with much and not very. E.g., I am very much afraid (one cannot say a very afraid man) / He is very much like his father, very much behind the others / They are very much alike.
