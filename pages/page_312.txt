Comparison and Case

10.50. Comparison and Case.—A comparison always
requires at least two things to be compared. It is im-
portant that we make clear to ourselves what are the
things thus compared. When we say, “She loves him more
than the child,” the comparison may be between the lady
and the child (more than the child loves him) or between
the husband and the child (more than she loves the child).
Fortunately, when a pron. is used, the meaning is made
clear through the case of the pron.—She loves the child
more than he (loves the child), or She loves the child more
than (she loves) him. See the meaning implied in the
following:—

You could do it better than I.
I could talk French as well as he.
There is no better man than he to take up this job.
They were admiring the Queen rather than Confucius.
The remark was intended for him rather than me.

Notice also the persons or things that are compared in the
following:—

Matthews wrote a longer essay than mine.
Her dress is a prettier pink than my wife’s
Your house is better situated and has bigger windows than
mine.
These stories are quite as interesting as those written by
Andersen.
