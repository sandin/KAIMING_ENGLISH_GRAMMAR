TIME OF ACTION

On the other hand, we have two alternate forms, knit and knitted, wed and wedded, quit and quitted for both the past and the p.p.

(b) We have vbb. with two forms, the past and p.p. being similar. Among these vbb., the p.p. never ends in -n (except beaten, which really belongs under “c”). Those marked with an asterisk (*) have also regular past and p.p. with -ed.
