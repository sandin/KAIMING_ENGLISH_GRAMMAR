TIME OF ACTION

The important thing is to form the habit of using I
shall and we shall for simple future instead of I will (and
shall I? in questions instead of will I?). Say I shall not be
able to and not I will not be able to, because this is simple
future, for be able is not something that you can “will.”
There is a tendency in modern English to use I’ll for I
shall (indicating simple future), because I’ll is shorter
and easier to pronounce: as I am afraid I’ll die soon
(strictly I shall). This is especially true of American
and Scotch usage. But one should nevertheless form the
habit first of following the correct usage of using I shall.

Will and shall are usually pronounced [l] and [ʃeːl]
or [ʃ-ːl] respectively: I’ll [ail], he’ll [hiːl], they’ll [ðeil],
I shall [ai ʃel]. Shan’t is pronounced with a clear [ɑː]:
You shan’t [ʃɑːnt] do this. There is a special use of
will, meaning “insist,” which is always pronounced full
[wil].

I told him not to go, but he will go (i.e., he insists on going).
Boys will be boys (i.e., you can’t expect boys to behave like
grown-ups).
But things will happen against our wish.

Also as a full vb. (not as an auxiliary), will is pronounced
full: God wills (willed) [wilz (wild)] that it should be so.

Exercise 102. Fill in shall or will in the following sentences
expressing simple future:—

1. They say he —— be promoted soon.
2. No one —— be able to stop him.
3. I am afraid I —— not be here tonight.
4. Who —— speak at tonight’s dinner?
5. —— he take part in the contest?
6. I —— not dare to tell him.
