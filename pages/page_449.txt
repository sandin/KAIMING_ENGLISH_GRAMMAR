SYNOPSIS OF FORMAL GRAMMAR

(The word “gerund” referring to a verb in -ing used
as a noun, as coming, going, serves no practical purpose in
modern English.)

ADVERBS

25. Definition.—An adverb is a word which modifies
a verb, an adjective or another adverb.

26. Classification.—Adverbs may be classified as
follows: simple, interrogative and relative. This classifica-
tion has no particular meaning except that the relative
adverb is one which introduces a clause and has an
antecedent expressed or understood: “Tell me (the time)
when you are coming.” Here the word time is called the
“antecedent” of the relative adverb when. Simple adverbs
are again classified according to their meaning, as adverb
of time (when), adverb of place (where, here), adverb of
manner (how, well, cleverly), etc.

27. Comparison.—Adverbs, like adj., may have three
degrees: positive (quickly), comparative (more quickly) and
superlative (most quickly) [§ 10.11].

PREPOSITIONS

28. Definition.—A preposition is a word which shows
some kind of relation and governs a noun as its object: on
the top, at the time. Sometimes it is followed by an
adverb: at once, for ever, from afar.

A preposition never stands alone in actual use, but
always forms a prepositional phrase.
