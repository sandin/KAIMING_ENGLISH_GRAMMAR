9.82. Economy in Phrase and Clause Modifiers.—We have found that there is a general tendency to make the modifying phrase or clause as short as possible. In certain constructions, words are often dropped (ellipsis). The clearest examples are:—

The man (that) I killed. (§9.68)
I found the handkerchief (that) you lost the other day.
Don’t talk while (you are) working. (§9.71)
Send it to me, when (it is) finished.
Give it to me when (it is) ready.
He dropped in on Monday evening, as (it) was usual, or as (it was) usual. (§9.691)
The reason that (=for which) I came is this. (§9.87) Or, the reason (that) I came, etc.

Notice also such extremely short constructions as all told (=if you tell, or count, all), everything considered (=when you consider everything), weather permitting (=if weather permits), see §9.42.

This economy of expression in modifying phrases and clauses is natural, because they are logically less important than the main clause.
