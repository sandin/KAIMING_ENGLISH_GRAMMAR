Do you know who you are speaking to? (To say “Do you know
to whom you are speaking” would lose the whole force of the
question.)

Note that in order to avoid leaving prepositions at the end
in the above sentences, phrases like for whom, with which,
about which will have to be used, and these constructions
are always awkward and roundabout.

9.53. But, Than.—“But” and “than” are sometimes
used, even by good writers, as prepositions followed by
pron. in the objective case, as follows:—

All but me had fled.
No one wishes it more than us.

Now both these words may be used as conjj., and therefore
but I and than we could also be used. As a rule, one
should generally avoid using the objective case, where but
and than could be used as conjj. with pron. in the nomi-
native case. In modern English, the only surely correct
usage of than as prep. with a pron. in the objective case
following is in the phrase than whom, as in—

The occasion called for a man of great wisdom and courage like
Mr. R—, than whom no one could suggest a better candidate
for the presidency.

As a conj., than may have a nominative or objective
pron. following, according to the circumstances. In the
sentence, “They treated him worse than her,” the meaning
is “worse than they treated her.” On the other hand,
“They treated him worse than she” would mean “worse
than she treated him.”
