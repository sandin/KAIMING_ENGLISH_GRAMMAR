REFLEXIVE AND RECIPROCAL PRONOUNS 153
yourselves. In general, these self-pronn. have two uses,
one to show reflexive or reflected action, and the other to
show emphasis. Examples of reflexive action are:—

Examples of the use for emphasis are:—

You yourself did it.                   They themselves are to blame.

I saw it myself.                           know.
Ask the lady herself.                  We ourselves would do the same
Tell him yourself.                         on like occasions.

In the above examples, the self-pronn. are used to
reinforce the meaning of the preceding pronn. and are
used in apposition to them. It is possible to use them
alone without preceding pronn:—

Ask herself.                           What ourselves would do is none
It was myself.     [myself.                 of your business.
My wife is the same age as             Ourselves are to blame.

But it would not be very nice to say Myself saw it, Himself
went there. There are also such uses as for themselves,
(the thing) in itself, (They sat) by themselves, and your own
self.
