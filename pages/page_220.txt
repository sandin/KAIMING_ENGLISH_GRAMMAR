DETERMINATION

Serve dinner.................Or: serve a dinner.
Under examination........Or: under an examination.

Now, in the above examples (go to school, etc.) all the seemingly concrete words school, church, class, bed, hospital, home, office, law-court really stand for some sort of action (teaching, praying, studying, sleeping, etc.). Hence, we can say:

Go to school.................Or: go to the school.
Go to hospital..............Or: go to a hospital.
Not in office...............Or: not in the office.
Beyond question............Or: beyond a question.
Take bath...................Or: take a bath.
Have dinner................Or: have a dinner.
Resign work...............Or: resign the work.
Sold at auction.............Or: sold at an auction.
Shut up shop................Or: shut up the shop.

And, because the above phrases are in very common use, therefore, we habitually omit the article before the nn. It is more idiomatic to say “Have dinner with me” than to say “Have a dinner with me.”

(2) A second source of trouble is that abstract nn, often have concrete meanings, and nn. of action (or, we may say, half-concrete nn.) often develop abstract meanings (cf. §§4.20-4.30). If we regard them as abstract, we often drop the article, and if we regard them as concrete, or partially concrete, we use a or the. Thus—

CONCRETE                                      ABSTRACT
