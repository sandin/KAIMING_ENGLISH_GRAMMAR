270 COMPARISON AND DEGREE

For emphasis, we have the expressions, the very best, the very worst, the very first and the very last. The word possible is also often added to a superlative in -est to emphasize its meaning:—

the best possible man for the job
the worst possible combination of fools and knaves
by the quickest possible route
at the earliest possible opportunity
make the greatest possible allowance

10.13. Superiority, Equality and Inferiority.—from §10.10 that a more logical division of the degrees of comparison should be on the basis of equality or inequality, as suggested by Jespersen. On this basis, we should have the three degrees:—

1. (>) older than . . . . . . . . (Superiority)
2. (=) as old as . . . . . . . . . (Equality)
3. (<) less old than . . . . . . . (Inferiority)

Notice that in expressing equality, we use the conj. phrase as . . . as, but in expressing superiority or inferiority, we use the conj. than. Instead of the pair as . . . as, so . . . as may also be used. Moreover, we can put in a n. between the pair, as well as between -er . . . than. E.g.—

He is as good a player as Morley.
He is a better player than Morley.

Very often, especially in the colloquial style, the phrase introduced by than or as is dropped as being understood.

But this will do just as well (as that one).
It is even better (than that one).
