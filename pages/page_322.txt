I fall down.                          I felled a tree.
I rise from bed.                      I raise my pencil.
I lie in bed.                         I lay the book down.
He was sitting there.                 He set his foot on England.
He looks round.                       He sees something.
He listens carefully.                 He hears the order.
You are talking.                      Can't you say something?
Speak!                                I have nothing to say.

Other examples of v.v.i. are: live, run, go, come, fly, swim,
walk, sleep. The important thing to remember is that an
v.i. cannot directly govern an object, while a v.t. can do
so. Thus we say see (v.t.) the water and enter (v.t.) the
garden, but we cannot say swim (v.i.) the water or walk
(v.i.) the garden.

Many vbb. are transitive in one particular context
and intransitive in another, and in these cases the dif-
ference in usage should be carefully observed. Thus
swim and walk are generally v.v.i., but we may neverthe-
less use them as v.v.t. in the following phrases: swim the
channel, swim one’s horse across, walk the hospital (= be a
medical student), walk the plank (= walk blindfold into the
sea over a plank on pirate ship’s side), walk the street (= be
a street-walker). Again, we may say: talk a language
(English, French), talk philosophy, talk nonsense, but we
cannot say talk a story or talk this sentence.

Study closely the different usage of the same vb. as
v.i. and as v.t. in the following, and note that often such
difference in use depends entirely on its association with
a particular word or phrase:—
