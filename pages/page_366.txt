TIME OF ACTION

comes after the present is naturally in the future. However, a slight distinction is noticeable. There is a difference between I am going to do it now or I shall do it now (after-present) and I am going to do it tomorrow or I shall do it tomorrow (simple future).

Notice that, on account of the fact that the past of shall (should) has a non-temporal use (i.e., not pertaining to time proper), it is defective and cannot be used for the after-past and cannot alone form the after-future. On the other hand, the expression be going to gives us a perfect conjugation in all tenses. Actually, be going to is as important a form for expressing future action as shall or will.

Again, actions may last a long time. Hence, we get another scheme of durative tenses:—

Before-past     I had been seeing
Past            I was seeing

Before-present  I have been seeing
Present         I am seeing

Before-future   I shall have been seeing
Future          I shall be seeing

In this case, what is before-present really started in the past and is continued down to the present. Before-future has very little actual use.
