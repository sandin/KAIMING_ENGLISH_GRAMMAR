3.81. Swear-Words.—English people swear as much
as Chinese do, although they swear differently. Swear-
words often express meanings which cannot be as force-
fully conveyed by other means. An English Major-
General swearing at his soldiers with “You pack of con-
sumptive little Maltese monkeys!” generally gets himself
obeyed. To call a man “a dirty dog” or a woman “a cat”
(spiteful woman) may save us the trouble of using many
long adjectives. The important thing to observe is to
swear at the right person and in the right atmosphere.
