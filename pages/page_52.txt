Exercise 9 Take some of the above words and make separate
sentences, using them now as nn., now as vbb.

There is a group of pairs of nn. and vbb. which
slightly differ from one another in pronunciation, the
end-consonant being soft or voiced in the vbb. and hard or
voiceless in the nn. In the case of [f—v], this difference
may be seen in the spelling, but in the case of [s—z], and
[ð—θ], the difference is usually not indicated.
