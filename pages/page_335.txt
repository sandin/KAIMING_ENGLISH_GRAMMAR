This pen writes very smoothly (really you write with it).
The song sounds very beautiful.
That rose smells wonderful(ly).
This fish smells awful(ly).
This chicken tastes delicious.
This window looks out on a patch of green lawn.
This stove cooks very well.
The sofa measures twelve feet.

This pipe does not draw easily (you cannot draw the smoke
through it easily).

Complete and Incomplete Action

11.40. Complete and Incomplete Action.—Expressions
like I have eaten and He has come back belong to the con-
clusive aspect, for they signify that an action has been
completed. Here the important idea indicated is not the
action in itself, but rather a condition as a result of the
action: not that I ate or He came back, but that I am in the
condition of having eaten (not hungry) or he is in the
condition of having come back (not away or abroad).
Such expressions indicate, therefore, a present condition as
the result of some past action.
