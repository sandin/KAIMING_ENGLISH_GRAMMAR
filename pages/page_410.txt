RELATIONSHIPS

classified roughly under the following heads, under each
of which, we shall examine the means of expressing them
in English. The conjj. play the most important role,
together with the conjunctive parts (relative pronn. and
relative advv.). Prepositional and participial phrases are
often employed instead of clauses introduced by conjj.; in
fact, they are always shorter and therefore make the
sentences simpler and easier to handle.

15.41. Combination.—The commonest form of rela-
tionship is combination. And and both . . . and may con-
nect any kinds of words or groups of words.

He was [both] defeated and tired (combining adjj.).
He played [both] fast and beautifully (advv.).
We saw each other off and on (advv.).
The arrow pierced into and through his chest (prepp.).
I paid both for him and [for] his friends (prepp.).
Both he and his wife escaped (subjects).
He was strong and he was handsome (clauses).

as, not only . . . but (also), furthermore, besides, in addition,
what is more, on top of that:—
