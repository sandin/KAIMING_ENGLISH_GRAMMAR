EXPRESSIONS OF POSITION

here used as adjj. It is important, therefore, that we recognize the close relationship between prepp. and advv. and adjj. of place or position. Study how the words far, near, with, without, besides, beside, away are used. Can all of them be used as prepp.?

It is even clearer that all prepositional phrases are used in adj. or adv. functions. These phrases are called “prepositional phrases” as regards their form (beginning with a prep.), and “adj.” or “adv. phrases” as regards their function:—

He came into the house (adv. modifying came).
He is in the house (adj. modifying he).

It is also interesting to note that (a) adjj. of position are often used as nn. and that we often have (b) a prep. + an adv., or (c) an adv. + a prep., or prep. + prep. (=compound prep.), the distinction between adv. and prep. here being, as we have said, arbitrary. Up to, down in, on to, e.g., are clearly compound prepp. like upon, into, unto.
