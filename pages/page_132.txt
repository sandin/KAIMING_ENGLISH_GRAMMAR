110 NUMBER AND QUANTITY

A mountain of printing paper 堆牀疊架
A sea of faces 人山人海
A shower of criticism 一陣
A package of things 一包
A packet of presents 一捆
A sack of flour 一袋
A wilderness of sweets (遍野) 極多
A world of trouble 極多,無窮
A mouthful of water 一口

A handful of men (一把) 幾個
A spoonful of salt 一湯匙
A jugful of water 一水瓶
A basketful of flowers 一籃,一筐
A tumblerful of milk 一玻璃杯
A tin of tomato soup 一罐
A bag of clothing 一袋
A pack of letters 一束
A jar of honey 一瓶
A pot of tea 一壺
A bunch of grapes 一束

Many of these words can of course be used for countable things also, as a bag of letters, beans or fruits. We can say a lot of, a pile of, an ocean of, or lots of, piles of, oceans of with practically no difference in meaning. For collective words, see § 5.23. See also § 6.20 for expressions of weight, and § 6.40 for expressions of size and distance.

Exercise 40. Try to use the expressions “a number of” and “a quantity of” in several sentences and show the contrast in meaning.

5.12. Abstract Nouns: Piece of Luck.—We have seen already (§ 4.22) that abstract nn. can be made concrete by the addition of words like case, instance, form, piece, bit, act, etc. Thus we cannot count abstract “information,” but we can count the “pieces of information.” Also, we cannot count “foolishness” or “malaria,” but we can count the “acts of foolishness (or folly)” and “cases of malaria.” Otherwise, abstract nn. are used like mass-words, as a great deal of kindness, much kindness, no little care, no little trouble, etc.

Exercise 41. Try to use the words instances, cases, forms, acts, piece, bit in connexion with abstract words like punishment, pleasure, theft, typhoid fever, nonsense, trouble, divorce, marriage, jealousy, poverty, disloyalty, dishonesty.
