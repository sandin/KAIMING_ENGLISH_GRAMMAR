PERMISSION, PROHIBITION, OBLIGATION, ETC. 79

You may (can) go.
You may not (=are not allowed to) tell it to others.
Passengers may not (=are not allowed to) smoke in their cabins.
Students may (=are allowed to) pay their tuitions in instal-

do so.)
You should be more careful.
You ought to tell him, (which you don’t).
Mr. Ellis ought to know, (he is an expert).
I thought that ought to be all right, (but it turned out to be
otherwise).
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, (but you are not).
You are not supposed to talk in class.
He is to (=is expected to) arrive tomorrow.
You are expected to hand in your compositions.
You are to go and fetch him.
He is supposed to be here already, (but he is late).
You are not supposed to know, (but I tell you secretly).
