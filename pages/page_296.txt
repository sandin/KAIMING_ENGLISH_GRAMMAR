274 COMPARISON AND DEGREE

stupendous production” or “played by the greatest galaxy
of stars” since human history began. The abuse of the
superlative is only an exaggerated form of the common
habit to use it in a loose, and consequently weakened,
meaning. Thus in the modern Pekingnese dialect, t’ing
(挺) has been developed as a weakened superlative for the
more logical ting (頂). T’ing hao means very much the
same as English “very good” (conveying very little
enthusiasm on the part of the speaker), while ting hao
means “the best.” In English, the word “dearest” has
probably been very often abused. But quite apart from
such conventional forms, weakened superlatives are em-
ployed everyday of our life. Thus we say, “He is a most
learned scholar,” “We spent a most agreeable evening,”
“I read a most interesting novel,” or “He was the funniest
man I ever saw.” In polite conversation, we also often
say “With the greatest pleasure” in reply to some request,
or “I shall be most delighted to see you,” when we mean
only “very delighted.”

Very, although not a superlative, is similarly weak-
ened, and its function is very often more euphonic than
logical, (like Chinese 很 in 很好, 很高, 很壞). This has
developed to such an extent that today, the words many,
few, little, much, far, near are less commonly used alone
than very many, very few, very little, very much, very far,
very near. That this is purely euphonic is shown by the
fact that when some other adv. is used, very can be very
well dropped.

There are very few, so few, not few people there. (Better than
“There are few people there.”)
