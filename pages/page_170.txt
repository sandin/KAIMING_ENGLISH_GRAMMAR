REPRESENTATION

|          | Singular     | Plural |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| First Person  | I            | we     |
| Second Person | you (thou)   | you    |
| Third Person  | he, she, it  | they   |

The words I, you, he, etc. used as subjects of vbb. are said to be in the “nominative case”; the words my, your, his, etc. are said to be in the “possessive case”; and the words me, you, him, etc. used as objects of vbb. (see me) or of prepp. (for me) are said to be in the “objective case.”

| Nominative | I      | (thou) | he   | she  | it   | we   | you  | they | who  |
|------------|--------|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Possessive | my     | (thy)  | his  | her  | its  | our  | your | their| whose|
| Objective  | me     | (thee) | him  | her  | it   | us   | you  | them | whom |

The peculiar thing about the pronn. in the objective case is that they are usually unaccented and are joined to the preceding vbb. or prepp. in pronunciation as if they were syllables of the same word. Thus—
