REPRESENTATION BY OMISSION
179

(I) Thank you!
(I) Beg your pardon.
(I hope to) See you tomorrow.
(Do you) Remember that letter?
(Think of) What people will say!
(That’s) Impossible!

(That’s) A good idea!
(Do it) Gently, please.
(It’s) Well done.
(Let’s) Have done!
(Keep your) Hands up (or: off)!
(Be) Quick!

On the other hand, we may have what Jespersen calls “pull-up sentences,” where the last part is left omitted as being unnecessary for the understanding of the complete meaning. The to with the vb. omitted is quite common in such endings.

He never came, although I told him to (come).
He did not take off the cover, although I had told him to (do so).
Come with me, if you care to (come).
Would you come?—I should love to (come).
We have asked him to pay at the end of this month, and he says he is willing to (do so).

Other kinds of quite common pull-up sentences are:—

I told him he was wrong, and he admitted quite as much (as what I said).
But Shaw is quite as great an author (as any we have been discussing).
He is not nearly so great (as the other one).
Chen-teh comes from the same place (where I come from).
I don’t like to offend one so powerful (as he).

Truer types of pull-up sentences are, for example:—

Well, I never (heard of such a thing)!
Well, go to (the thing you want to do, and I will not object)!
If I only knew about this an hour ago!

It would be bad grammar not to recognize these as complete sentences simply because some of their parts are understood. Such grammar could be a hindrance, instead of a help, to the power of expression
