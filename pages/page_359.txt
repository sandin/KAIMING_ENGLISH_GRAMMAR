TRANSITIVE ACTION
337

The first there is pronounced [ðɛr], while the second there
[ðɛə]. The second there serves as a complement to indi-
cate a place, while the first there indicates nothing at all.

(NOTE.—In there’s, the pronunciation is usually [ðɛəz], some-
times [ðɛrz]).

In Let there be light, there sounds suspiciously like a n.
(compare Let it be done). However, we are still forced to
call it something other than a n., and analyze the sentence
as Let light be there. It would be much better to regard
there is or there be as a compound vb. deserving to be
written as one word and meaning “exist.” Let there be
light means “Let light exist,” or “Let light come into
being (or existence).”

Transitive Action and Objects

an object (I kill—I kill him), but an intransitive vb.
cannot (He is sleeping). It has already been mentioned
(§ 11.21) that this distinction between vv.t. and vv.i. is
also purely grammatical. A transitive action is supposed
to pass in, some way or other into its object, while an
intransitive action is not: I see the boy, but I slept. Now
it is quite clear that in I kill him, the action passes into
the object him, but in I see the boy, does the action really
pass into the b y? Note also that enter is a v.t. (He enters
the room) and that come is an v.i. (He comes into the room),
but is there actually any difference between He enters the
room and He comes into the room? Therefore it is clear that
the difference is not logical, but grammatical. The gram-
