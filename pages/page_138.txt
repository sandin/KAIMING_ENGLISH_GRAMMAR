of the boys. It is better to say The class elect him as representative than The class elects him as representative, because it is the class members who do the electing. On the other hand, it is better to say The class is represented by him rather than The class are represented by him, because we mean the class as a whole is represented. Study also the following:—

The train (dead thing) arrives (never arrive).
The library (dead thing) was burnt (not were).
There are (or is) a class of words called “collectives.”
The family have (or has) moved out.
The Jewish tribe are (or is) a wandering race.
The people are standing in the rain.
The Chinese nation is becoming westernized.
Look at the crowd. They must number over 10,000.
If you let the other class know, they will laugh at you.
One thousand people. Twelve clergy. Twenty police. Six hundred sheep.

What one must remember is to be consistent. We should not say, “The Cabinet has decided at their last meeting,” or “The Cabinet have decided at its last meeting,” although this is a natural and common mistake, due to change of mind or carelessness. It always makes for clearness to use the words the members of, when we mean the separate individuals in the group.

Exercise 42. Try to use the following collective words and expressions:—

1. The members of the class.
2. The members of the church.
3. The members of the family.
4. A group of people, students, children.
5. A flock of sheep, geese.
6. A herd of cattle.
