40 PARTS OF SPEECH & CHANGE OF FUNCTION

The “e” is pronounced in the -edly combination, although it may not be pronounced in the participles: thus confused [-zd] and marked [-kt], but confusedly [-zidli] and markedly [-kidli], as in markedly different.

2.50. Prepositions Used as Adjectives.—In English, the short words called prepositions are very useful, and one should learn to use them in order to make one’s language idiomatic. Thus put the dress on is more idiomatic than wear the dress, and put the light out is more commonly used than extinguish the light. Following are examples of prepp. used as adjj.—

The light is out.
The game is on (=being played now).
The meeting is off (=cancelled).
His mind is off (=crazy).
We are off at last.
Is he in (=in the house)?
No, he is out (=not at home).
Dinner is over (=finished).
I am through with you (=I will have no more to do with you).
She is up (=She has got up from bed).
Is the meeting over (=finished) now?

There are also some adjj. which are often used like prepp. We may say in cannot do it like you, and do not talk like that, the word like is a prep. and like that, like you are prepositional phrases used in adverbial functions. Yet in It looks like going to rain and He is like his father, the word like still has a very clear adjective function. We may call like in these cases a prepositional adjective, or an adjective with the prepositional power of governing a noun.* Also the word near is often used as an adj.
