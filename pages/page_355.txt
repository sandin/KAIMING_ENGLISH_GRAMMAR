GRAMMATICAL SUBJECTS AND OBJECTS 333

12.12. Grammatical Subjects and Objects.—It has already been pointed out that the terms “subject” and “object” merely indicate grammatical functions. Further illustrations will make this clear. In “The statue stands (in the yard),” “The mountain stretches (to the north),” “The street turns (to the right),” and “The bridge spans (the river),” “The food agrees (with my stomach),” none of these things, statue, mountain, street, bridge or food, really does anything at all. With abstract nn. this is still clearer: “The question arises,” “School opens,” “The semester begins,” “The problem includes (many factors),” “A lawsuit drags on, or hangs on (for years).” Here the subjects are really incapable of any action.

In the same way, in We hold a meeting, it is hard to see how we can do anything to the object “meeting,” or in Give him a warning or Teach him a lesson, how the warning or the lesson is affected by the man who wants to give or teach it. In take a bath, take a look, take a seat, do we really do anything to “the bath,” “the look” or “the seat”? And in He cut a funny figure, just how was that imaginary thing “figure” affected by the person who “cut” it?

All these show that the relationships indicated by the “subjects” and “objects” are merely grammatical. It is advisable therefore to distinguish between the “doer” of an action and the “subject” of a vb. on the one hand, and on the other, between the “party affected” by the action and the “object” of the vb. The terms “doer” and “party affected” are notional, while the terms “subject” and “object” are grammatical.

(NOTE.—It is considered advisable to avoid the terms “logical subject” and “psychological subject” which mean so many different
