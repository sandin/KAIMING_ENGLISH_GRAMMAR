PHRASE AND CLAUSE MODIFIERS 227

The words please and suppose retain still clearly the force of an imperative vb. in Please ring the bell and Suppose he won’t consent, but are coming dangerously near to being advv. in—

Will you please do that? (Cf. “Will you kindly do that?”)
Suppose we go to bed. (in imperative, as a formula of proposal)

A’so, there are sound-descriptive words, like pop, crash, bang, which are somewhat different from usual vbb. in character, but which are both used as vbb. and as advv.

[As vb.] Pop the question (=propose marriage) / pop in and out (=go or put suddenly) / pop the pistol.
[As adv.] Pop goes the weasel (name of a country dance) / Something inside there goes pop (=breaks with a pop).

[As vb.] Bang the door / Doors bang.
[As adv.] Hit him bang in the face / He fell bang on the floor.

[As vb.] Crash through the gate / The whole building crashed down.
[As adv.] A piece of stone came crash through the window.

It may also be noticed that the word let in let alone (=not to speak of) is often used in a place where a participle or an infinitive would seem to be required:—

He cannot unify his own province, let alone unifying the whole country (really we will let alone the question of, etc.)
