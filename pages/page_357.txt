"IT" AS SUBJECT

so expressed in English. We have the following forms
expressing about the same thing:—

(A) Who believes such a story is a fool.
(B) He who believes this story is a fool.
(C) He is a fool to believe this story.
(D) He is a fool if he believes this story.

Grammatically speaking, in “A,” who believes such a story
is the subject; in “B,” he is the subject, with the relative
clause who believes this story modifying it; in “C,” he is the
subject with the infinitive phrase to believe this story modi-
fying the vb. is; and in “D,” he is again the subject, with
the subjunctive clause if he believes this story modifying
the vb. is. This is all very correct, because if he did not
believe this story, he would not be a fool. The infinitive
phrase in “C” and the if-clause in “D” therefore properly
modify the vb. is, and not the subject he. But, notionally,
don’t they come to the same thing as he who believes this
story in “B” where the who-clause modifies the subject he
and not the vb. is? And, notionally, is not he who believes
this story in “B” as much the subject of is as who believes
such a story in “A”? Do not—

Believing this story, he is a fool
and     If he believes this story, he is a fool

really say the same thing? So it is correct to say that, in
He is a fool if he believes this story, we really mean he-who-
believes-this-story is a fool. Therefore, notionally speak-
ing, he-who-believes-this-story is the subject of the vb. is.
