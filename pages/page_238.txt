MODIFICATION

Exercise 67. Make sentences or phrases with the following material. Decide which of the following types you wish to use:—

(a) a small, clear handwriting (without conj.)
(b) a tedious and long speech; a clever, but unsteady chap (with conjj. and, or, but, though, although)
(c) that stingy, dirty, little black backyard (piling up modifiers without conj.)

1. Horse—great, Arabic, racing.
2. Car—new, smart-looking, smooth-running, 1929 model.
3. Pen-knife—good-looking, useless.
4. Friend—formerly close, now forgotten.
5. Journey—eventful, miserable, long, three-day, exciting, wonderful, second, etc.
6. House—yellow, red-roofed, foreign-style, cheap-looking, small, moss-grown, ivy-covered, etc.
7. Essay—well-written, clear, not brilliant.
8. Student—so-so, not too good, not too bad.
9. Dress—bright-coloured, silk, new, smart, too thin.

9.24. Subordinate Modifiers (3 + 2 + 1).—There are some characteristic combinations of this type which need to be studied. The simplest combination is of course of the type well (3) written (2) essay (1), or much (3) older (2) man (1). The third rank need not always be an adv.; it could be an adj. or a n. Thus—

English     (3)    grammer     (2)    teacher     (1)
ready-made  (3)    boot        (2)    shop        (1)
second-hand (3)    book        (2)    store       (1)
newspaper   (3)    manager’s   (2)    office      (1)

In the case of ready-made boot shop, one should try to avoid confusion by the way of hyphening or joining words. Thus one should avoid such spellings as ready-made boot-shop, and dirty clothes-basket; ready-made boot shop and dirty-clothes basket are preferable.
