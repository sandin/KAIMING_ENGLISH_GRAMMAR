REPRESENTATION

There are two compound pron. each other and one another, which indicate reciprocal action. Examples of their use are:—

Do you know each other?                    Copy sentences for each other.
Ask each other questions.                   Tear each other's hair.
Change dresses with one another.            Look into each other's face.
Tell one another stories.                   Each looks into the other's face.
Share one another's money.                  They hate each other.
Share money with one another.               Each hates the other.

Each other and one another are now used in the same way. The distinction between each other for two persons and one another for more than two is neither necessary, nor useful, nor historically sound.

Exercise 26. (1) Make some sentences using the self-pron. in the emphatic sense (I myself, you yourself, etc.).

(2) Make some sentences showing reciprocal action, with vbb. like help, fight, cheat, dislike, quarrel, make peace with, trade with, salute, suspect, trust, recognize, know, despise, etc. Also the material in the above examples may be freely drawn upon.

7.24. General Person: “One,” “People,” etc.—We often say “one may think,” “people may think” with reference to a vague general person or society in general. This is really neither in the first, nor in the second, nor in the third person, because it really includes all three. There are various ways of expressing this abstract general person in English. Study this:—

{People may think you crazy.
{They may think you crazy.
{One may think you crazy.

To hear you talk like that, one would think you are crazy.
On looking over the statement carefully, one is tempted to think that you are paid to sing praises of the Board.
