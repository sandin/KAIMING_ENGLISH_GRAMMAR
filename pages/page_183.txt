THING-PRONOUNS
161
things, as well as pronn. for persons. Following are the
common pronn. for things in English:—

all         none        that        these       such
some        most        this        one         former (前者)
any         what        those       which       latter (後者)

For lack of a better term, we may call these “imper-
sonal pronouns” or “thing-pronouns.” It should be re-
membered, however, that most of these thing-pronn. can
refer to both persons and things, and that, on the other
hand, the “personal pron.” it does not usually refer to
persons. The important point is that representation of
thing-words is expressed by means of these pronn.

It can be easily seen that almost all these words are
originally adjj: from I like those apples to I like those.
Study the following:—

It will be noticed also that, with the exception of this,

can be either in the singular or in the plural.
