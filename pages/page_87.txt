not in the sentence, we must also use no, and not yes. A
sentence like Yes, he will not come is highly unidiomatic in
English.

Q. Isn't he you- brother?
A. (Yes, '9 is.) No, he is not.
Q. Haven't you got your book?
A. (Yes, I've got it.) No. I haven't.
Q. You are not going away tomorrow, are you?
A. No, I am not going. (never say: Yes, I am not going.)
Q. And you don't mind missing this trip?
A. No, I don't mind. (never say: Yes, I don't mind.)

3.55. Emphatic Negation.—There are various ways of
making strong negatives by the use of certain phrases, by
a retort question (as in emphatic affirmation), or some-
times by an obviously impossible statement. As a strong
negative is often very useful, one should learn at least
some of these phrases. Some of the commonest ones are
seen in the following:—

Tsung-chang feels not the least bit sorry for his brother's death.
He is not at all sorry.
He is by no means sorry.
Far from it. (He is far from being sorry.)
Most certainly not.
Absolutely not.
He does not remember at all when or how the watch was lost.
I cannot possibly allow you to do that.
That watch has no earthly use for me.
He hasn't got a blessed penny.
Not a single man remained.
He didn't understand a single word of it.
There is none whatsoever.
None of your impudence!
None of your nonsense!
He is not a bit ashamed.
