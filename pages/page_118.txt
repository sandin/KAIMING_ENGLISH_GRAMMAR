96 PERSONS, THINGS AND THEIR GENDER

n. is felt to be less exact, less specific and less artificial.
(It should be remembered that all names are artificial.)
The cigarette I smoke is called Craven “A”; there is no
reason why it may not be called Creighton “X” The
name is, therefore, quite artificial. The phrase China
sea may be a common name, but when we decide to call
the sea on the east of China the China Sea (with capital
letters), we give it both a more exact name and a more
exact meaning. When I call this book the Kaiming
English Grammar, I am giving a comparatively exact,
specific and artificial name to the book.

4.41. Proper Nouns and Capital Letters.—Proper nn.
must begin with capital letters in writing. We may write
the kings of Europe or a college dean, but when we refer to
the King of England or the Dean as a proper name, we
begin it with a capital letter. When it is uncertain
whether it is a common or proper name, usage also
differs. We use capitals when we regard a name as a
proper name, otherwise we use small letters. Thus we
write North China, but northern China or Northern China,
the far East or the Far East, western Europe or Western
Europe, the orient or the Orient, Chinese classics or the
Chinese Classics. Many words which were originally
proper names have now become common names and are
written with small letters, as china (porcelain), champagne
(wine), italics (type), boycott* (movement), cynic (man).
Adj. and vbb. made from proper names are generally
also written with capital letters: Chinese, European,
Anglicize, Romanize (also romanize).
