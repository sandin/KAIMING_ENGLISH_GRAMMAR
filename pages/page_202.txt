CHAPTER VIII
DETERMINATION

8.10. Representation, Determination and Modification.—
When we say this book, that book, my book, the book that you
took away, we are using various ways to indicate or
“determine” the particular book we mean, and this we
call the problem of determination in grammar. Gram-
matical means of determination always answer the ques-
tion “Which one?” Further examples are:—

the same book          either this or that book
the other book         each book
some other book        the respective books
every other book       any old book
the second book        whatever book

It will be seen that there is a close relation between
determination and representation. The pronn. he, you,
they, myself, themselves are all representative words, and
yet they all help to “determine” which person we mean.
“His book” also helps to answer the question, “Which
book?”

There is also a close relation between determination
and modification. We say, for instance, that in the red
book, the adj. red modifies the n. book. It describes what
kind of a book it is. But the word red serves also to limit
the meaning of book by excluding the green ones, the blue
ones, etc. It, therefore, also helps to “determine” the book
meant. Generally, the modified nn. have a narrower or
more restricted meaning than unmodified nn. “Northern
