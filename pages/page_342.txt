ASPECTS OF ACTION

The present progressive, rather than the present indefinite, is the regular form used for present action, as shown already in § 11.10. We say, “At this moment, some people are dying (not die), some are being married (not are married) and some are being born (not are born) into this world.” We also say, “Look here, I am holding (not I hold) this book.”

The past progressive indicates that something was going on,—more commonly that something was going on while something else happened. E.g.—

I was reading upstairs, when I heard the windows shaking and bottles clinking in the cupboard.
They were dancing and drinking, when the police broke in.
I was waiting in the station when I saw a woman’s face, which seemed very familiar to me.
I was looking at the sailing clouds when some one slapped me on the back.
