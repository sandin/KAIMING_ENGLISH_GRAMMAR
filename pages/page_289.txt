THE “THREE DEGREES OF COMPARISON” 267

can gangster) is not necessarily a “good” man, and a
“more honest” man than the Minister of Communications
may not be a really “honest” man at all. This student is
“older” than that student, comparatively speaking, but,
absolutely speaking, neither of them is really “old.” So
the positive degree (old) is really absolute, while the
comparative and superlative degrees (older, oldest) are
relative.

Thus we come to the conclusion that the “better” man
is not better than the “good” man, and we shall find also
the “best” man is not really better than the “better”
man. The “best” man is simply “better” than all the
rest. If A is thirteen, B is twelve and C is eleven, then,
clearly, A is only older than B and C, although he the
oldest. And then A really is not “old” at all.

10.11. The “Three Degrees of Comparison.”—In Eng-
lish, we have the endings -er and -est for the comparative
and superlative degrees, as in older, oldest, while there are
no special endings to indicate the degrees expressed by
less old and least old, which are often expressed by younger
and youngest. Moreover, the longer words do not admit
such endings, but are used with more and most. The
general rules are:—

(1) Words of one syllable can always have “-er” and
“-est.” E.g.—
great          broad          new          deep
greater        broader        newer        deeper
greatest       broadest       newest       deepest
