Chinese and English Compared

In a way, the Kaiming English Grammar contains within its covers the adumbrations of a new comparative grammar of the English and the Chinese language. This, again, reduces itself to a comparison of the English and Chinese notional categories and the different means employed to express these notions. The points mentioned, however, are strictly of a practical, rather than theoretical, nature, and are made in order to help the Chinese students overcome certain psychological difficulties. Many common grammatical mistakes can be corrected very easily by this psychological method, and by no other way. Where there are national differences in the notions themselves, the obvious way is of course to train the Chinese students in the new way of thinking. And where common notions exist in both languages, as in the majority of grammatical categories, the most interesting thing would be to show how differently the two languages express these notions. English grammar, presented in this way, therefore, teaches the English ways of thinking and expression. The student is constantly made to ask himself this question: If I have a given idea, how shall I express it in English?

Why Mistakes Are Made

The distinction between notions and their expressions is merely a logical, not a real, one. There is no thinking which is not a way of expression, and no expression which is not a way of thinking. We think while we talk, and many ladies talk in order to find out what they think.
