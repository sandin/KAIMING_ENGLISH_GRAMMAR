TRANSFORMED PHRASES AS MODIFIERS

we can have moderate-sized houses or moderately sized houses,
but must say green painted and not greenly painted.
Foreign-built houses does not mean that they are built by
foreigners or in foreign countries, but that the houses
themselves are in foreign style. These cases will be
made clearer from a study of the following paragraph.

9.26. Transformed Phrases as Modifiers.—In the above
examples, good-mannered man and well mannered man,
moderate-sized building and moderately sized building, we
have really two types of modifiers. The type well man-
nered man and moderately sized building is easy to under-
stand or analyze. The other type really belongs to a large
class of modifiers which are quite freely formed in Eng-
lish. These may really be regarded as phrases trans-
formed into modifiers for the sake of convenience and
brevity. Thus—

A moderate-sized building = a building of moderate size.
A good-mannered man = a man of good manners.

The concepts moderate-size and good-manners are taken as
a whole, given an -ed, and used as modifiers.

Two most important and useful types of such modi-
fiers transformed from phrases are worth studying:—
