It may be said that the tenses formed with the
auxiliaries to be and to have are invariably used to indicate
a condition rather than an action.

The past indefinite (e.g., He took away my umbrella / We
won / This happened) is naturally used more freely than the
present indefinite, because most actions belong to the past.
A thing either happened some time ago or is happening
now. That is why the past indefinite is used as much as
the present continuous.

11.11. Being and Doing.—Among all the English vbb.,
the vb. to be occupies a very special position. It may, in
fact, be considered a class in itself, possibly with similar
vbb. denoting the process of becoming, like become, grow,
get, turn. While the vb. to be states what the subject is,
all the other vbb. state what the subject does. This is
especially clear in such sentences as:—

(Doing) He told me to go alone. That was what he did.
You left the party in the middle of the dinner. You
oughtn't to have done that.
You are the only person who likes sour things. All the
others don't.
Some people go to church, and some don't.

(Being) Some people are sensitive to such remarks, others are not.
He was afraid to go alone. Indeed he was.
(For further examples of this difference, see §3.40)

The consequence of this distinction is that while the
vbb. of action may have objects, the vb. to be can never
have an object, but only a complement to complete its
meaning (It is important / He is dead / He is my son).
Consequently, when a pron. follows the vb. to be, it is put
in the nominative, and not the objective case.
