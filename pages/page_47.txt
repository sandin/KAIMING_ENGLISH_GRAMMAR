NOUNS AS ADJECTIVES
25

In these phrases the preceding n. is always used as
an adj. to modify the following n. The relation between
them is quite various: stone wall means wall made of stone,
honey-bee means bee producing honey, food problem means
the problem of food, and fire brigade means a brigade for
fighting fire. One should learn this kind of expressions
because it is simpler, and helps to make simpler sentence
constructions possible. Thus it is easier and more natural
to say the nine-o'clock arithmetic class than to say the class
in arithmetic which comes at nine o'clock, and it is easier to
say the Pacific Mail Steamship Co. (or Co.'s) sailing schedule
than to say the schedule for sailing of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Co. It is better English to say He owns a paper
mill than to say He owns a mill for manufacturing paper.
It is more idiomatic to say motor roads than to say
motor-car roads or roads for motor cars. A motor road is
perhaps less exact, logically speaking, because the road is
not run by motors, but it is better English.

In this way, English is so much like Chinese. We say
journey expenses for 旅費, China tea for 中國茶, fly-paper
for 蒼蠅紙 and Nanyang College President for 南洋公學校長.
Moreover, this is often the only logical way. It would be
wrong to say fiery brigade, watery pipe, geographical class
and tubercular doctor for fire brigade, water-pipe, geography
class and tuberculosis doctor. The pipe is not watery, and
the class is not geographical, nor is the doctor suffering
from tuberculosis himself. In other cases, both forms may
be used: college student or collegiate student, China tea or
Chinese tea, Japan tour or Japanese tour, and South China
or Southern China. The use of the adjectival form tends to
describe a quality of the object rather than the object itself.
