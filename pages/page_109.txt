SWEAR-WORDS

Swearing could be very vulgar, although, in Chinese,
vulgar swearing is indulged in by our perfectly respect-
able uncles and aunts. An English student, however,
should learn at least some effective and comparatively
respectable forms of swearing. Some convenient and not
too mild swear-words are: Bother! Botheration! Dash it!
The cursed ——! You blasted fool! I’m bloomed (damned) if I
know! That blessed son of yours! By (St.) George! and By
Jove! (Jupiter) are quite inoffensive to Christian ears,
as also Ye gods! and Great Heavens! Ladies may use
milder forms like Dear me! Oh dear! Oh my! My good-
ness! or Good gracious! The word damned (a damned thing,
damn it!) with its slang form darned should generally be
avoided before the ladies, although it may be quite the
thing in certain classes of society, and although St. Paul
used it frequently in the Bible. In very familiar circles,
sometimes a little liberty with the popular damned may
be allowed. As a substitute for damn, we may use dash,
and as a substitute for bloody (bloody nuisance, all bloody
fine, bloody quick) we may use blessed (not a blessed cent, but
awful nuisance, awfully good).

The taboo on swear-words varies from time to time
and according to people’s changing beliefs. Now that
people’s fear of hell-fire is disappearing, it is quite all
right to use “To the hell with ——!” because it no longer
hurts. Swearing by God is generally not allowed, al-
though the longest example of this form of swearing is to
be found in the Roman Catholic official curse or anathema
used in excommunicating people from the church.
