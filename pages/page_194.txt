172 REPRESENTATION

has done when he speaks of “grammatical pattern” (for type of structure) and “the drift of language” (for tendency of language). Instead of saying, “Mr. MacDonald began to deal with the problem directly,” it would be an actual improvement in expressiveness to say that “he came to close grips with the problem.” Instead of saying, “Mr. Lloyd George’s efforts at pleasing some Conservatives,” one might speak of “Mr. Lloyd George’s flirtations with them” (cf. Chinese 吊膀子). And instead of saying, “He tries to locate the economic distress,” one could say, “He tries to find out where the shoe pinches,” and it would be better English.

Indirect Statements

7.60. Direct and Indirect Statements.—Very often we want to quote or restate what another says. We have a direct quotation, with a capital and quotation marks in the following:—

Mr. Barker said to his son, “I am going away from the city for a few days, and you should come home to see your mother everyday.”

This can be made into an indirect statement as follows:—

Mr. Barker said to his son that he was going away from the city for a few days and that he, the son, should come home every-day to see his mother.

This is also a case of representation and the indirect statement may also be called a “represented statement.”

In direct quotations, we must use the exact words and consider the quotation marks as sacred. If words are omitted, we should indicate the omission by a dotted line.
