REPRESENTATION

7.41. Some, Any, None.—Some is used in questions and affirmative statements. Any is used in questions and negative statements.

Do you have some?           Do you have any?
I have some.                I haven't any. I have none.
Can some (one) tell me?     Can any (one) tell me?
Some can tell me.           None can tell me.

Exercise 50. Fill the blanks with the proper words (some, any, none):—

1. There are.........
2. Are there........?
3. May I have........?
4. I don't want........
5. Give him........
6. Don't give him........
7. You haven't seen all, but you have seen........
8. No, I haven't seen........
9. Haven't you seen........?

7.42. What.—What (=that which) is a very useful word expressing the idea represented by the Chinese so (所). What he knows is this=他所知道是這樣. See if you can use the following phrases in sentences:—

what one knows                 what is useful, useless
what one can see               what is true, false
what I am afraid of            what he said
what you do in a day           what you heard
what the government wants      what they saw
what you pay for               what frightens him
what makes me hate him         what woman wants
what everybody knows           what to say, think, do

As what means that which and already contains the antecedent in itself, we cannot say all what, but should say all that. But what is chiefly colloquial: in literary use, generally but that is used.

That is all he knows, or That is all that he knows (not all what he knows).
