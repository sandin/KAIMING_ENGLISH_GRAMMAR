THE SCIENCE OF EXPRESSION

ways of expressing them. In studying English grammar
in this book, we shall always ask ourselves this question:
If we have this idea, how shall we express it?

1.11. We must understand that all grammatical forms
and constructions are simply ways of expressing notions. If
we have the idea that it's raining outside, we express this
in Chinese by saying hsia-yu la (下雨了), or perhaps t'ien
hsia-yu la (天下雨了), and in English by saying It rains.
But It rains means the same thing as hsia-yu la, although
the way of saying it is different.

If we look closely, we see the English expression has
a subject it, which is absent in the Chinese sentence. We
find also the letter s (pronounced [z]) added to the word
rain, which is also not found in Chinese. But the con-
struction with it and -s is really only a means of express-
ing an idea or notion. In the following, we shall find the
English language has different grammatical forms for the
general idea It rains:

It rains.                              下雨了.
Does it rain?                          下雨了吗?
Is it raining?                         正在下雨吗?
It is going to rain.                   要下雨了.
Has it rained?                         下过了雨吗?
Did it rain?                           (昨天)下雨的吗?

You see the changes in Is it —ing? Has it —ed? Did
it —? are not useless changes of form merely, but are the
means of expressing notions. Again take the sentences:

He strikes me.     I strike him.

In Chinese, we would simply say:

T'a ta wo (他打我). Wo ta t'a (我打他).
