318 ASPECTS OF ACTION

I had not been able to send him any money.
Still he had not appeared.
I did not go to meet him, because I had not been notified.

Very often, phrases like I had intended, I had expected are
used to indicate that what was intended or expected never
took place.

I had intended to call on you yesterday afternoon (but some
friend called, so I was not able to go).
I had expected some help from him (which never came).
I had thought some sort of arrangement might be made (but later
realized that this was impossible).

(5) The future perfect indicates the conclusive aspect
in some future time. E.g.—

At fifty, you will have made enough money to retire comfortably.
By that time, Freddie will have grown up into a big boy, and Eda
most probably will have been married.
You post this letter now, so that when you go to see him the day
after tomorrow, he will surely have received the letter
already.

(6) “Have had,” “had had.” Chinese students are
often puzzled by this combination. Really it is very
simple, for the first word, have, serves as an auxiliary
(as in have come) and the second word, had, serves as a
principal vb. In English, have as a principal vb. can
even be put in the passive voice:

Four can be had at 10 cents a pound.
Nothing is to be had there (=There is nothing to buy at that
place).

Hence its use as a principal vb. in have had (for the
present) and had had (for the past) is easy to under-
stand.
