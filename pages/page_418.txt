The second member of comparison may be a n., a vb.,
an adj., an infinitive phrase, or a whole clause.

Noun or pronoun: This is better than that.
Verb: I would do anything rather than let him get off
like that.
An infinitive: He knows better than to go out alone on such a
night.
An adjective: This is more than fine: it is excellent.
An adverb: I have read it more than once.
Clause: He spends more than he is earning.

We can also have a complex sentence in which the second
member is woven into the first clause:

Here we have the main clause This is much and the de-
pendent clause as much as I can stand, serving as an adv.
clause modifying much.

The usual words expressing conformity are: according
as (followed by a clause), according to (followed by a n.),
