SIMPLE, COMPOUND & COMPLEX SENTENCES 385
contracted forms (=He came and he went / He went and I
went contracted). But this has no practical meaning
except for grammarians who are in the habit of classify-
ing things.
Thirdly, we have real compound sentences, like the
following:—
He wen’t away, so I came.
I came, because he went away.
Either you said so, or you didn’t.
You broke it, therefore you must pay for it.
He wanted to go, but he didn’t.
It is seen in the above that the conjj. so, because, etc. serve
to connect two separate sentences into one, each part
having its own subject and predicate.
So far, no clause has been introduced that is woven
into another clause. He went away is clearly separate
from I came. The moment we introduce a clause which is
woven into another, or serves as part of its structure, we
have what is called a complex sentence. For example—
I didn’t say this. (Simple)
I didn’t say that I wouldn’t go. (Complex: that I wouldn’t go
serves as object in the main clause.)
That is unknown to me. (Simple)
How he did it is unknown to me. (Complex: noun clause as
subject.)
The man went away. (Simple)
The man who was with you went away. (Complex: relative
clause as modifier of man.)
In the above three examples of complex sentences, we
have the conjj. that, how and the relative pron. who serving
to connect the new clause with the original main clause.
