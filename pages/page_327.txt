11.22. Intransitive Vbb. Used Transitively.—There are
certain cases where an v.i. is used transitively. These
are different from the cases discussed in §11.20, where the
vb. is used as a v.t. in certain connexions, and as an v.i.
in other connexions. Here we are discussing certain vv.i.
used in some definite ways so that they still keep their
meaning as vv.i., but can apparently have an object.

(1) First, we have cases like dream a dream, die a
natural (an easy) death, smile a (sweet) smile and sleep the
sleep of the just (i.e., sleep soundly like men without
worry), where we do not have a real object, but what is

(2) Secondly, we have phrases like smile consent or
acquiescence, which means to express consent or acquiescence
by a smile. The consent is not “smiled,” but is really
only expressed by a smile. Other examples are:—

She looked her consent.
He looked the thanks he could not express.
He said nothing, but looked all love and sympathy.
Mr. Astor said nothing, but laughed dissent (showed his dissent

cry one’s eyes out and talk the horse’s hind leg off. Notice
that in all these examples, the idea of until is understood
(cry until one’s eyes are out, and talk until the horse’s hind
