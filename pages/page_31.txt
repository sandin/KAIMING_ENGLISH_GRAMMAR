OUTLINE OF THE COURSE

various ways of making statements or denials, asking questions, giving commands, expressing doubts and hopes, etc. (Ch. III) Next under the general notion of “Things” (Ch. IV), we learn the English distinctions of persons and things, abstract and concrete things, mass-words, personification and gender (Ch. IV). Then we go on to study the English notions of number, quantity, (much, many, seven per cent), weight, value (pound, shilling), distance (yard, mile, within call), position and shape (Chs. V-VI).

VII), we shall study how words may be used to take the place of other words (chiefly covering the pronouns, but including also other ways of representation, as I told him to, for I told him to take the cover off).

X), we shall study the different expressions of degree. We come then (Ch. XI) to a discussion of the ideas of “Action,” and first come the notional classes called “Aspects of Action” (as begin to read, keep on reading, make one read, etc.).

XIII: present, past, future, coming after, coming at the same time, etc.). Chapter XIV is devoted to a discussion of the English distinction between fact
