16 PARTS OF SPEECH & CHANGE OF FUNCTION

position before the public), as an adj. in the adv. phrase 白晝見鬼 (to see ghosts in broad daylight), and finally as an adv. in 白受損失 (to meet a loss without compensation). Sometimes, we do change the form of the word, as luan for disorderly as adj., and luan-tse in nau luan-tse (鬧亂子) for creating disturbance, or making a scandal as a n.

But in English, as a rule, the words change their form with the change in function. E. g., we have admire, vb., admiration, n., admirable, admiring, adj., and admirably, admiringly, advv. Hence, the Chinese student of English must learn to feel a sense of the different parts of speech, before he can use the different forms correctly.

Sense of Function

2.14. Sense of Function.—There are five points in the sense of grammatical function which must be learnt by anybody who wants to speak correct English without difficulty. They are (1) the sense of thing (for nn.), (2) the sense of action (for vbb.), (3) the sense of quality (for adjj.), (4) the sense of manner and aspect (for advv. and adjj.), and (5) the sense of prepositional force (for prepp.). These feelings have not been trained in the Chinese student, because the Chinese language does not demand a vivid feeling of these grammatical differences. For instance, whether a word is a vb. or an adj. generally makes no difference in Chinese grammar, but the Englishman feels the difference between He fears (vb.) and He is afraid (adj.). The Chinese student must therefore feel the same way as the Englishman does before he can handle the parts of speech correctly and without difficulty.
