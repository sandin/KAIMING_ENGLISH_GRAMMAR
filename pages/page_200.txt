(II) Correct the following by changing the tense of vbb. or filling in words where omissions are unjustified:—

(2) For psychological reasons, we often omit the beginning or the last part of a sentence, when we consider the part expressed as sufficiently clear. This is true especially in answers to questions. In this sense, “Yes” and “No” may stand for almost anything expressed in the question. Also—

How many do you want? (Ans.) Four.
Would you have it (the egg) fried or scrambled? (Ans.) Fried.
Would you have it boiled hard or soft? (Ans.) Soft, or medium.
Is this quarter past three? (Ans.) No, ten past.
Would you have tea or coffee? (Ans.) Coffee.
Shall I bring you a pen or a pencil? (Ans.) Both.
Do you like it? (Ans.) Rather!

In very common expressions, we often omit the first one or two syllables, out of simple laziness.

(Good) Morning!                          (I am) Present!
(Will) That do?                         (He or She is) Absent!
(You) See what I mean?                  (I am) Sorry.
(I am) Here!                            Fraid not. (=I am afraid not)
