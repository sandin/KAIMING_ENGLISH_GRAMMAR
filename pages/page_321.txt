TRANSITIVE AND INTRANSITIVE VBB. 299

It is I.
This is he who started the trouble.
Who is it?
If it wasn't he, it was somebody else.

Also, while we can use the auxiliary vb. do with any other
vb. (does not go, does not wish, does not have), we cannot use
it with the vb. to be (does not be is unknown).* The vb.
to be is simply not regarded as a vb. of action. The
Chinese translation of tung-tz'ǔ (動詞) for “verbs,” there-
fore, fits in with all vbb. except the vb. to be. In German,
the vb. is called a ‘time-word’ (Zeitwort) which is, in
this respect, more satisfactory.

Transitive and Intransitive

11.20. Transitive and Intransitive Vbb.—This is the
usual and the most important classification of vbb. In
usual grammars, vbb. are divided into the three classes:
(1) Transitive, (2) Intransitive and (3) Auxiliaries. The
distinction is so important that all dictionaries indicate
whether a vb. is transitive (“v.t.”) or intransitive
(“v.i.”), for without knowing this, the vb. cannot be
employed correctly. The essential difference is that a
v.t. takes an object, but an v.i. does not. In terms of the
aspect-notion, the difference is that, with a v.t., the action
passes to another object, while, with an v.i., it stops with
the subject. Following are some interesting pairs of vv.i.
and vv.t.—

*Auxiliaries like must and can also do not admit do, but they are
not declinable. The vb. to be is the only declinable vb. that cannot
go with do.
