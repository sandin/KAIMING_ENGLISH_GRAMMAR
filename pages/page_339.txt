It was the longest funeral procession I ever attended.
But: Of all the funeral processions I have ever attended, this was the
longest.

(3) In connexion with “since,” we always say that
since some time ago or since something happened (point of
time), something else has happened (period of time):
Since he arrived yesterday, he has not been seen. This means
that he arrived, say, at six in the afternoon yesterday
(point of time), but that from that time till the present
(a long period) he has not been seen. Study the following
examples:—

Since that quarrel (Since they quarrelled), they have never met
(or spoken to each other) again.
I have not been able to write a single word since last week.
Lord Lytton has made half a dozen calls since his arrival.
There have been three floods in China since 1910.
Husbands and wives have quarrelled since human marriage
began.
Man has sinned since the world began.
I have not been to Europe since I returned in 1910.
He has joined the communists since his mother died.
Many things have happened since you went away.
He was once bitten by a dog during his childhood, and since then,
he has never dared to come near a dog.
The patient has made great progress since he entered the
hospital.

(4) The past perfect indicates the conclusive aspect in
some past time, e.g.—
He had arrived before me (or before I arrived).
When I arrived, he had signed the check already.
It had begun to rain before I started, so I was well provided.
They had decided to go already, so I could not say anything.
The girl had been neglected by her aunt with whom she was living
(consequently she looked very thin, etc.).
