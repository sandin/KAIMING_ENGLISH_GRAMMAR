CO-ORDINATE MODIFIERS
215

Don't worry about such small, little things.
It was only a tiny, little spot.
That was your great, good luck (not great good luck, but great luck
and good luck).
He had a tremendous, big fortune.
He had some excellent, good wine.
It was a terrible, fearful-looking thing.
You dirty, low-down dog of a scoundrel.
She had a rich, golden voice.

Finally, we have some very common combinations,
where the several modifiers are not truly co-ordinate. If
we examine the phrase that nice young lady, we find that
this means something rather different from that young
nice lady. The second form is usually not used, unless we
want to emphasize the word nice. We see, therefore, that
young lady forms a concept by itself which is modified
by the word nice, and we mean really a nice young lady,
and not just a nice lady, nor nice and young lady. The
formula for this is really 2 + (2 + 1). Similarly, we say
“Take the first fast train” if we emphasize the fast train
idea, and “Take the fast first train” if we emphasize the
first train idea. It will be noticed, therefore, that the
most closely related modifier always stands next to the
word modified. Other examples are:—

your new straw-hat                 a grand wedding party
every New Year's Day               his teacher's profession
his uncle's new book               her woman's heart
a big Christmas dinner             her mother's heart

In the last example, mother's heart forms a concept
(=heart of a mother) modified by her. “The loss of the
baby broke her mother's heart” means that it broke her
motherly heart, and not the heart of the baby's grand-
mother.
