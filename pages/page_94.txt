3.64. The Indirect Question and Noun Clauses.—Very often we want not really to ask a question, but only to state a question, as He asked me why I came late. In such indirect questions, we do not invert the order between subject and vb.

Who are you?...................I know who you are.
Where is he?....................I don’t know where he is
Why didn’t he come?..........The teacher asked why he didn’t come.
What did he say?..............I didn’t hear what he said.
What shall I do?..............The student asked what he should do.

In this way we get many noun clauses beginning with such interrogative words as what, who, why, how, where, when. We often also use the words whether and if, as in He asked whether (if) he might join us / I wish to find out whether (if) he is still there. These noun clauses are used like single words as far as their grammar is concerned, i.e., they are treated as one noun. E.g.—

He has done it. How he did it does not concern us.
Whether we are going to have a good or bad government depends on ourselves entirely.
How old she is is not for me to ask.

In Find out what is the trouble (what the trouble is), we may consider the word-order as normal (not inverted) with what as subject and is as vb. (cf Find out who is there). But a sentence like Find out how is that to be done (instead of how that is), or How old is she is not for me to ask is strictly not correct, although many English writers often make this mistake
