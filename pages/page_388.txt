13.62. Declinable Substitutes for the Auxiliaries.—Because will, shall, must, can have become auxiliaries, these
words are not declinable, i.e., they do not have a full
conjugation. There is, for instance, no past for must (He
must go yesterday is not English). Modern English, however, has developed substitutes for these words, which can
be expressed in any tense like other vbb. These substitutes
are in every way as commonly used as the auxiliaries
themselves: thus I am going to tell him is just as common
a way of expressing future as I will (or shall) tell him.
We have, then—

shall or will = be going to
can = be able to
must = have to

Be Going to

Past     I was going to see him.
Present  I am going to see him.
Future   I shall be going to see him.

Be Able to

Past     I was able to pay him.
Present  I am able to pay him.
Future   I shall be able to pay him.

Have to

Past     I had to pay him.
Present  I have to pay him.
Future   I shall have to pay him.
