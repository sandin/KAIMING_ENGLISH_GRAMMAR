SENTENCE MOODS

refers to something to be done in the future. We have
then the forms:—

Past He had to pay. We were to meet that day.
Pres. He has to (=must) pay. We are to meet often.
Fut. He will have to pay. We are to meet this afternoon.

The Prince was to visit the Capital on the 12th means that
at that time the Prince had not yet visited the city, but it
had been arranged for him to do so on the 12th.

Exercise 31. Make a few sentences using had to, has to, will
have to, are supposed to, is expected to, ought to, was to, were to, is to.
Make some sentence with must and change it into the past or future
tense, and see how you will have to change the expression.

3.75. Conjecture and Possibility.—May, can and must
are also used in a different sense, that of conjecture.
Suppose something has been lost, we may hear the follow-
ing conjectures about the thief:—

Who can it be?
It cannot be Mr. Y——, for he was not in the room.
Can it be the cook?
It may be the cook’s nephew who was here alone.
It may be he, or it may be a burglar.
No, it cannot be the cook or his nephew, and there were no bur-
glars here. It must be the policeman.

Thus we have the three forms, can it be? (with it cannot
be), it may be and is must be. Compare in this connexion
the use of hwei (=can), in Chinese in 會不會是他? and i-
ting (=must) in 一定是巡警. Must is very often used in
this sense. E.g.—

You must be very hungry now.
He must be dying now.
That must be the real reason why he came here.
