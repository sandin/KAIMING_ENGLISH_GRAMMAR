9.21. The Use and Omission of Hyphens.—From such examples, as fireman, fire-brigade and fire station, one can see that the same logical combination between modifier and modified may be sometimes written as a single word, sometimes as a hyphenated compound, and sometimes as two separate words. In this respect, the English language presents a disgraceful chaos and confusion, and even usage cannot be always depended upon, because different writers and different dictionaries adopt different forms of spelling.* Some people write blackboard, penknife, postgraduate, and others write black-board, pen-knife, post-graduate. Again some people write water-pressure (水壓), wet-nurse (乳母), blood-heat (血溫) (with a hyphen) and others write water pressure, wet nurse, blood

* The Modern English Usage says, “The chaos prevailing among writers or printers or both regarding the use of hyphens is discreditable to English education” (p. 243), and again, “usage” is “so variable as to be better named caprice” (p. 245).
