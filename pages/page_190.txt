Metaphors

7.50. Metaphors and Figurative Expressions.—Every language has its metaphors or figurative expressions and English is no exception. Metaphors have one great value in a language in maintaining the balance of concrete imagery in it and preventing it from becoming a mere abstract, logical dialect of the scientists and professors. They preserve for it always the smell of the soil, as it were. The English language is considered a virile language just because it is full of metaphors and metaphorical uses of words. In spite of the great increase of scientific vocabulary, real modern English remains racy and fresh because of the many figurative uses of its simple and homely words.
