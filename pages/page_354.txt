332 SUBJECT AND OBJECT

subject of the vb. when it does not exist, as, for instance,
in 下雨了 (compare 雨下了), 不行了, 不對了. We also say
有一次, 有一天, where we do not really know what is the
subject of the vb. 有

12.11. Object and Party Affected. — The object is
always the party affected by the action. In He told me, of
course the object me indicates the person affected by the
act of telling. But, conversely, the party affected is not
always the object: it may be the subject of a passive vb.,
as I in I am told. Notice also that, with the vb. to be,
where no action is indicated, there is no party affected,
and consequently no “object,” but only a “complement”:
as in He is her husband, where her husband merely com-
pletes the meaning of is (see § 9.90).

An object is affected by an action usually, but not
always, as the receiver of the action. In He opens the door,
of course the object door directly receives the action, as it
were. But there are two special kinds of objects, which
are affected in a different way. The first is the object of
result, as in dig a grave, where the grave is the result of
the digging. There was no grave until some one dug it,
and consequently there was really nothing there to be
affected by the action. Examples of this kind of object
are We make cakes / They form a circle / He writes a letter /
He paints flowers. The other kind, which may be called
the repetitive object, really repeats the vb. only, as in She
dreamed a dream / He smiled a smile / They fight a good
fight. This is very similar, logically, to the conception
that Rain rains or Snow snows (although we merely say It
snows, It rains in English).
