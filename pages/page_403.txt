THE POTENTIAL MOODS
381

(3) Wish. A wish often refers to an untrue supposition, and therefore the past tense is quite generally used, (see § 14.22, form “3”). See also § 3.73.

I wish I knew.
I wish I were dead.
I wish I were in your place.
I wish you would (or could) come. (Not will.)
But: May God bless you! May the Devil take you!

(4) Hope, fear, doubt. These often involve forecast of future events, and therefore very naturally employ the future will (2nd and 3rd persons) and shall (1st person).

I doubt whether I shall be able to do it.
I have no doubt he will be able to do it. (Is able is also correct, but less common.)
I am afraid I shan’t be able to come.
I’m afraid that will be the end of his romance.
I hope you will come. (But: “I hope you are satisfied”—referring to the present.)
We hope that China will become (not becomes) a strong nation.
There is no doubt he is the best boy of the class. (Referring to the present.)

(5) Judgment and supposition. This has been fully covered in §§ 14.21-14.22 already. The purer the supposition, the more the subjunctive form is used. “That might be true” has a stronger subjunctive connotation than “That may be true.” Compare “I suppose he can do it and I know he is going to do it” with “I suppose he could do it, if he wanted to.”

(6) Obligation. In British usage, ought is quite often used, much more so than in American usage, which often uses should instead.
