SYNOPSIS OF FORMAL GRAMMAR

17. Classification.—Verbs may be classified as transitive, intransitive and auxiliary.

Transitive verbs may directly govern an object, as: “I see (v.t.) you (object)” [§ 11.20].

Intransitive verbs do not govern objects (I was sleeping), but may be followed by a prepositional phrase (I was sleeping in his bed) [§ 11.21].

An auxiliary or helping verb is used with other verbs, as: “I can see” / “I will go” [§ 13.60].

For the past tense, the verb to be has also distinctive forms: I was, thou wert, he was, we (you, they) were.

The forms with -est for thou (Thou comest) and the forms with -eth for the third person singular (He cometh) are archaic.

20. Participles.—Verbs which are used like adjectives are called participles. The present participle is always formed by adding -ing, while the past participle is usually formed by adding -ed. The irregular verbs form their
