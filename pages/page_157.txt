CHAPTER VI
WEIGHT, VALUE, SIZE, SHAPE AND POSITION

6.10. National Differences in These Categories.—The English expressions of weight, value, size, distance, position and shape differ quite considerably from the Chinese. One should learn to use these expressions correctly and to know their exact meaning.

6.20. Expressions of Weight.—There are in measures of weight, as in measures of size and distance, two systems, one the old English system which is in general use, and the other the so-called “metric” system, more in scientific use. The metric system is quite simple. Both gram and gramme may be used in all these words.

gram = about 15 Troy grains
decagram = 10 grams
hectogram = 100 grams
kilogram = 1,000 grams
decigram = 10th of 1 gram
centigram = 100th of 1 gram
milligram = 1,000th of 1 gram

The most common term is kilogram which is about 2.2 ordinary pounds. In the old English system, there are again two series of weight measures: one the common weight, or avoirdupois (pr. [,ævədʊ'pɔɪz]) weight, and the other used by gold- and silversmiths, called Troy weight. The avoirdupois pound is heavier than the Troy pound, and is equal to 12 Chinese ounces. Study the following equivalents (the abbreviations are put in brackets):—
