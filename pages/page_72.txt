SENTENCE MOODS

phrases are always used as modifiers. Exclamations are regarded as independent parts in the sentence, as Ah! here he is.

In My uncle grew angry, angry modifies the subject uncle, and in He was considered lost (They considered him lost), lost modifies the subject he. So words inside the predicate may modify the subject.

1. Columbus discovered America by luck.
2. Magellan sailed around the world.
3. Magellan made the first sailing trip around the world.
4. He got angry with me, and called me an impossible fool.
5. The sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening.
6. He left home for a long time, and was considered dead by his family.
7. Spell your words correctly, and copy them with ink, not with pencil.
8. Meet me at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.
9. I saw him crossing the street.
10. He was seen walking with Miss C—.
11. The detective came too late, and found the thief gone and the room quite empty.
