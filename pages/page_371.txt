CHINESE “CHIANG” AND “YAO” 349

7. If we are caught, we —— all be sent to prison.
8. —— we stay away very long?
9. —— we go very far?
10. The matter —— be settled soon.

13.32. Chinese “Chiang” and “Yao.”—The distinction between simple future and intention is best illustrated through their Chinese equivalents. Chiang (将) and chiu (就) and originally the meaning of “going,” “going near” and “following,” like the English going to, and like going to they are used to indicate simple future. It is going to rain (simple future) is easily translated by 将 (要) 下雨了 and 就 (要) 下雨了. It will be finished soon, or It is going to be finished soon (simple future) is easily translated by 就 (要) 完了. (This is true also of the French language, where “I am going to come,” je vais venir, is used to express simple future.)

The word yao (要) originally expresses intention. 他要來不要來? = Will he come or not (is it his intention)? But like will in English, it also takes on another meaning indicating no intention, but simple future: He will die soon = 他快要死了.

13.33. “May” and “Is to.”—Shall and will (with be going to) cover the three usual expressions of future action: simple future, command and intention. Two other forms, possibility and obligation, are usually expressed by may and be to. Thus He may or may not come and I may go away tomorrow are as much forms of expressing future action as I will go or You shall go tomorrow. Notice also that we say I hope he will go and I hope he may go, both indicating future action.
