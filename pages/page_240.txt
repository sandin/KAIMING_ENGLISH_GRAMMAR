It may be noticed now that the use of hyphens in the
above examples is somewhat irregular. Thus we hyphen
well-arranged, but not admirably carried out; again, we
hyphen long-drawn-out, but not tightly fastened down. This
difference, it should be clearly understood, is largely
dictated by convenience only; we do not as a rule use any
hyphen unless it is necessary or is a help toward clearness.
The hyphen serves to show that the whole group of words
is used in one grammatical function, thus ready-to-hand is
used as one adjective. Like the parenthesis in “(2 + 3)
+ 1,” it serves to bind the group together as a unit.
Thus we write “This piano has not yet been paid for,” but
“this unpaid-for piano.” In long combinations, like
“admirably carried out plan” or “tightly fastened down
mouth,” the use of hyphens is felt to be unnecessary and
awkward-looking.

Exercise 68. Try to make phrases of the “a,” “b,” “c,” “d,”
“e” types discussed above, by taking those given examples as models
and change parts of them. Thus from the following originals, one
might make the modifications:—
