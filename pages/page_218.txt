Exercise 63. Make some sentences with the phrases studied in
this section.

8.73. Omission of “A” and “The.”—The use or omission of “a” or “the” is often a difficult thing to decide. Many foreign students who have studied English for ten or twenty years still often find a doubt in meeting with such a question. Thus, shall we say “find a doubt,” or “find doubt” or “find doubts” in the above sentence? There is a psychological reason for this difficulty, and we shall soon see it.

(1) It is clear that, as we have said in §8.70, abstract nn. and mass-words require no article (the or a), when the meaning is indefinite, but require the definite article the, when the meaning is definite. Thus:—

INDEFINITE                           DEFINITE
He wants power                      But: He wants the power to vote.
Drink water.                        But: Drink the water in the cup.
