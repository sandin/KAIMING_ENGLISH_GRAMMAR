OMISSION OF “A” AND “THE”                                      197

Hence, we also say have patience, take time, spend money, because patience, time, money are regarded as abstract nn., and eat ice-cream, drink tea, add milk because ice-cream, tea and milk are mass-words (§4.51).

So far so good. But examine the following common phrases, all with the omitted:—

go to school (hospital)            out of job
in school (class)                  at sunrise
after class                        at night (but: in the night)
after dinner                       by day
during dinner                      all day long
have (take) dinner                 at noon (midday)
go to church                       without (beyond) question
after sermon                       without doubt
go to bed                          sold at auction
lie in bed                         shut up shop
out of bed                         open shop (school)
at table                           take bath
go to law-court                    in fashion
at home                            for (on) sale
not in office                      on business

Notice that all the nn. in the above examples refer to some action or event. The peculiarity of an action or event is that it is half visible and half invisible. We can see some people eating at dinner; therefore, we say we can see the dinner. And yet we cannot touch the dinner (or dining) as we can touch a table. These words are therefore half concrete and half abstract words, standing between the abstract nn. hunger, satisfaction and the concrete nn. knives and forks. Hence, we sometimes use, and sometimes omit, the article. We say:—

After crying..................Or: after a good cry.
Give help.....................Or: give a help.
