GRAMMAR AS THE SCIENCE OF EXPRESSION 3

English uses the forms me and him to express the persons that are objects of the verb strike. But in Chinese, we express the same idea just as clearly by always putting the object behind the verb. This word-order in Chinese has the same grammatical value or purpose as the English distinction between I and me, he and him. Sometimes, this object-notion is expressed in Chinese by the use of pa, as in pa mên t'ui k'ai (把門推開, push open the door), pa jên ta ssŭ (把人打死, kill the man), and pa ch'ien ch'iang tsou (把錢搶走, rob his money). The use of pa to introduce the object, therefore, may be regarded as a Chinese grammatical means for expressing the object-notion.

1.20. Grammar as the Science of Expression.—In the above, we have seen already that two languages may express the same notion or idea by different grammatical means. That is why the study of a foreign grammar should be very interesting, because it teaches us to compare the two languages, and helps us to express our ideas in the correct foreign way. Take, for instance, the group of notions called “Number.” We find there are notions of indefinite number, like more than sixty, or 六十多, 六十餘. Some Chinese students often make the mistake of saying sixty more, whereas the correct English way is to say over sixty, or sixty-odd. The old-style grammars do not teach this, because the old-style grammars are interested only in the forms of singular and plural, like girl, girls / child, children. They do not bother about the rest when there is no change in word-form. We have to study this expression over sixty, because we start from the notion we wish to express, and here is an English expression that we must learn. Again, the old-style grammars teach us that there
