"SHALL" AND "WILL"
75

Actually, however, we seldom use the direct command, and prefer to put it in a milder form, even when speaking to a servant. Thus it is difficult to draw a sharp distinction between a command, a request or a gentle suggestion. We may say to a servant Will you bring me some cold water? or Will you look after the baby? Will you? and will you please? are probably the commonest forms. But even will you? is already too much like a command, when we wish to ask a doctor to come to our house: we generally say can you?, or even better (because more indirect), Could you come to my house now?

As friendly advice, the commonest form is probably you have better, or you had better (go). It is always more indirect and sounds less like a command when we use the subjunctive forms should, might, could. An extremely indirect way is to use I should, as I shouldn't reply to him at all, (if I were you).
