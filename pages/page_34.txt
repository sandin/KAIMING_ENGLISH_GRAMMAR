12 PARTS OF SPEECH & CHANGE OF FUNCTION

2.11. Definitions.—The purpose of a definition is to help us decide what a thing is and what it is not. The definitions of the parts of speech are to help us decide to what part of speech a word belongs. Such definitions are not easy to find, and are often as inaccurate as grammatical rules. But practically we do feel there are eight classes of words, and the following definitions will be found generally useful. We can best decide to what class a word belongs by looking at its grammatical function, i.e., the work it does in the sentence.

(1) Nouns denote things.

A thing may or may not be visible (as table, sound, grammar); it may be living or dead (man, dog, pencil); it may be an action or event (a fall, a flood, a dinner, a meeting), or a condition or an invisible quality (sickness, beauty, cunning, danger, poverty).

(2) Pronouns take the place of nouns.

Thus in John speaks to his mother, but she does not hear him, the word she takes the place of his mother, and him takes the place of John. In Take this book, don’t take that, the work that is a pronoun taking the place of that book.

(3) Verbs tell what people or things do. (But the words is, can, must, will, have, etc. are also called verbs.)

There is not one definition of the verb which is perfect. Generally a verb is the important word which says something and gives life to the sentence. In a good man, the meaning is dead, for we say nothing about the good man, but in He is a good man, or The man is good, the verb is at once gives life to the sentence.
