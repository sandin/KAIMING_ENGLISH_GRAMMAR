refers to her husband not by mentioning his name, but as

commodity to Shanghai,” instead of writing more bluntly
“General Y— has sent a consignment of opium,” he is
using representation to avoid going into gaol.

The pronn. are, of course, the most important class of
words used for representation. In this chapter, we shall
study not only the forms of pronn. but also the purposes
for which representation is used. We shall also study
various means of representation besides the pronn., such
as the use of metaphors, indirect statements and repre-
sentation by omission.

forms are put in brackets.
