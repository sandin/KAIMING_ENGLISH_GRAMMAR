9.52. Prepositions at End.—In idiomatic and colloquial English, as distinguished from pedantic writing, the prepositions are very often left at the end of a sentence or clause. “He is the man you are looking for” is more idiomatic than “He is the man for whom you are looking.” This is because, in English, the prepositions form with their preceding verbs or adj. definite phrases with a very definite meaning, like look for. In spite of what many grammarians say, a truly natural and idiomatic English style cannot get along without often allowing prepositions to stand at the end of sentences or clauses. The following examples of extremely common and idiomatic sentences will suffice to show this English tendency.

What are you doing that for?
What are you looking at?
That will give you something to think about.
You can never tell what this will lead to.
Do you think he is a man you can depend on?
People in famine districts will eat anything they can lay their hands on. (“Anything on which they can lay their hands” would sound pedantic here.)
That depends on what they are cut with. (Not “That depends on with what they are cut”)
The Government did something you would never dream of.
