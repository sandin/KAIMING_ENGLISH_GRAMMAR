see [看]           saw            seen

Auxiliaries

13.60. Might, Could, Would, Should and Ought.—The past forms of the auxiliaries may, can, will and shall are, of course, might, could, would and should. In addition, there is the auxiliary ought, which is the past form of the vb. owe. The use of these words should be specially studied.

(1) They are used as past forms in dependent clauses. When we transform a direct statement like “He said, ‘I will come.’” into an indirect statement, we have to substitute would for will: He said that he would come.

I didn’t know what I should do (= was to do) at the moment.
He said he would be coming in a week.
You didn’t think he could do it, did you?
I thought he might want to leave his home for a change.
The doctor said that a week’s rest should do him a lot of good.
So I asked him to get the money ready, and he said that it should be arranged.
