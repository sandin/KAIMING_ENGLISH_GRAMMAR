THE PARTICIPIAL PHRASE AS MODIFIER 235
1. You dare to go alone. 4. We needed to show him everything.
2. They dare to tell me that. 5. We need to come too.
3. You need to be so careful. 6. He needs to be reminded of it.

(NOTE.—The above sentences are formed for practice only, and
are not quite idiomatic. In affirmative sentences, dare to is used,
but always stressed, while need to is seldom used, its idiomatic form
being have to (须) and not need to. Need in the affirmative is usually
used in constructions like need something, he needs a book, a pen, etc.)

The Participial Phrase

9.40. The Participial Phrase as Modifier.—The parti-

reason is that they have not learnt to distinguish between
vbb. expressing an action and vbb. expressing a state or
condition. This is best illustrated in the sentence: 我站在
那兒等着他 (I stood there, waiting for him) and its varia-

particle cho (着) serves the same purpose as the ending -ing
in participles to indicate a condition:—

我站在那兒等着他。 I stood there, waiting for him.
我站着等他。 I waited there standing.
我坐着等他。 I waited there sitting.

One should learn to subordinate the vb. describing a
condition and put it into the participial form. One could
