can do) is to wait.
Who knows but that (but what) he may have purposely told you
a lie?
Who can tell but that (but what) he may be the most important
man in the country three months hence?

7.43. One, Thing, Affair, Something, etc.—The use of
one representing persons has already been discussed in
the above (§7.24). Thing and affair are not usually con-
sidered as pronn., but the fact remains that these words
are most commonly used in English to represent almost
any kind of things. Study the following:—

Such a nice one (referring to dress, hat, Christmas tree, apple,
etc.).
Give him a good one (punch him hard, pitch a baseball).
That's a good one (a good joke, retort, etc.).
A short life and a merry one.
Select the best ones. Throw away the bad ones.
He started the next revolution, if it may be called one.
Stay at any one of the dozen families you know in town.
The ones (photographs) you saw.
Open the drawer on the left, the one with a key in it.
He writes many poems, but publishes only the ones he likes.
The top one. The lower one. Little ones. A new one. Two old
ones. Such a one.
(For persons) The lucky ones. The young ones. One so fair and
beautiful. Like one weary of life. Like one in a dream.
Like one risen from the grave. Offending one so powerful.
Marry one worthy of you. One who talks. One who dares.
I don't know a thing about it.
I don't understand the whole thing.
The thing, or affair (perhaps a performance, a party, a dinner,
a match, or a wedding), was a complete failure.
That's the thing (the thing we want, the right thing to give or
to do, etc.).
