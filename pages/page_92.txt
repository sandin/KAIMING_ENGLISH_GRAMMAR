3.62. The Tag-Question.—The “tag-question” is found both in Chinese and English. You are fifteen years old, aren’t you? is psychologically and grammatically the same as the Chinese 你十五歲,是不是? This is really a question following a statement (affirmative or negative). Psychologically, it implies that I believe more or less already that you are fifteen years old, but that I am not quite sure about it. He has arrived already, hasn't he? implies that I know already he has arrived, only I am not positive about it; it is, therefore, quite different from Has he arrived yet? Sometimes this is used as a gentle command, as Take this away, will you? Sometimes it is used sarcastically, as So you think you are going to get away with it, don't you? (you need not think you will get away so easily); or So you killed your husband quite innocently, didn't you? (I don't believe in your innocence).

Two important points, however, must be observed. (1) the auxiliary or helping vb. used in the tag-question must be the same as the one used in the preceding statement. He has arrived already, isn't it? (for hasn't he?) in analogy to the Chinese 他來了,是不是? would be quite wrong. (2) If the preceding statement is affirmative, the tag-question must be in the negative, and vice versa.

2. They have told you about my coming, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
3. You wouldn't want to be late, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
