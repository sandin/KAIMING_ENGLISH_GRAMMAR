“MORE BETTER,” “NEXT BEST,” ETC. 269

Exceptionally, however, we do sometimes use -er and -est for emphasis, e.g., “This is the confoundedest problem I ever came across,” which is more expressive than most confounded. Such cases are really abnormal deviations from the regular rule for some special reasons of rhetoric.

NOTE.—When we add the ending -er or -est to words ending in -y, we change the y into i, when it follows a consonant, but keep it unchanged, if it follows a vowel: thus, happier, lazier, clumsier, but gayer, coyer. Phonetically, gayer retains the original “long a” sound, which is not lowered as in prayer (=禱文): gayer rhymes with layer (n.), and not with mayor, prayer, there, care. A single final consonant preceded by a single vowel is doubled when -er or -est is added to it: thus thinner, fatter, but quicker and cheaper.

10.12. “More Better,” “Next Best,” etc.—Two cases are worthy of special mention. In vulgar speech, and among Chinese students, the phrase “more better” is often used. This is not in accordance with good usage, although it can be found in Shakespeare, who also gives us “the most unkindest cut of all.” The psychological reason for this mistake is the desire for clearness and emphasis.

On the other hand, the expressions “next best,” “second best,” “third best” are perfectly good and very convenient forms of expression, equivalent to Chinese 第二好, 第三好. English has also the expression the largest but one (two, three) equivalent to Chinese 第二大 (第三, 第四大) respectively.
