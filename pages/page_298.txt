276 COMPARISON AND DEGREE

For Confucius’ taste, rice could never be too white, and mince-
meat could never be chopped too fine (食不厭精, 脍不厭細:
could never be white enough = the whiter, the better).
Your gown is too bright-coloured for this occasion.
I am too tired to work tonight.
This food is too hot to eat, too hot to be eaten, too hot for me, too
hot for eating, too hot for me to eat, too hot for comfort.

There are also phrases like above normal, above my ability,
beyond my power, beyond his means (= too expensive for
him), beyond me (=beyond my ability or my under-
standing), beyond (any) doubt, beyond (any) question.
Notice also the prefixes which express the same notion as
too: overeat (=eat too much, eat more than is good for
one’s health), oversleep (=sleep overtime), overwork, overdo
(=go too far in something proper or commendable in
itself, as, “Don’t overdo it”), overreach oneself (=reach
out so far that one falls—often figuratively); supernatural,
supernatural superhuman, superdreadnought (= warship of
the class above Dreadnought), superfine (in commercial
language, =of extra quality); hypersensitive (=over-sensi-
tive), hypercritical (=too critical), hypertension (of nerves
or blood pressure).
