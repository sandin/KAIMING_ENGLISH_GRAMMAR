THE NOMINAL PHRASE
261

By means of such economy of expression, the English
language has attained a greater simplicity and ease than
the German language, for instance.

9.83. The Nominal Phrase.—The law of economy has
resulted in another type of phrase very similar to the
absolute participial phrase mentioned in § 9.42.

(a) He was carried into the house, head first (= with his head
first).
(b) I can win it hands down (= without trouble).
(c) We walked together, arm in arm.
(d) He was carried into the hospital, his face a mass of bleeding
flesh.
(e) The nurse entered the room, pencil in hand, to take down
the patient's name and address.
(f) Bit by bit, the patient recovered.

In each of the above sentences, there is a descriptive
phrase introduced by a n. followed by a word or phrase
modifying it.

The absolute participial phrase may be considered as
a special kind of nominal phrase. It differs from the
others only in having the n. followed by a participle (as
weather permitting, everything considered).

9.84. Joining of Phrases.—It most frequently happens
that several rel. clauses or several participial phrases
come together in a sentence, giving us the which ... and
which or —ing ... and —ing construction. Instead of and,
sometimes but is used. This is a very useful construction
and quite simple, so long as the writer keeps to this
formula.
