816 ASPECTS OF ACTION

tion “Where did he study?” one merely says “He studied, etc.”)

The mother says, “I have cared for him, sent him to college, and given him the best of everything in life.”

(2) The difference between present perfect and past indefinite is illustrated in the following imaginary dialogue:—

Scrups: Where’s Thomas?
Howard: He has gone away. (present condition)
Scrups: I didn’t know that. When did he go? (past action)
Howard: He went away on Monday. (past action)
Scrups: What’s he doing? Have you got any news from him? (present condition)
Howard: Yes. He sent me a telegram from Cologne. (past action)

The points of difference are, therefore: (1) the present perfect refers to the present, while the past indefinite refers to the past; (2) the present perfect denotes a condition, while the past indefinite (except with the vb. to be) denotes an action; and (3) consequently, the present perfect covers a long period of time, while the past indefinite (generally) refers to a short point of time. We say “Did you see the President?” when we mean to ask whether he saw him or not (as an action), but “Have you seen T— lately?” when we mean to ask whether for the last few days (an extended period) he has seen T—. Consequently, we can say “I saw him just now,” or “I just saw him” (point of time), but I have not seen him for a long time (period of time). Notice also such idiomatic expressions:—

This is the best book he ever wrote.
But: Of all the books he has ever written, this is the best.
