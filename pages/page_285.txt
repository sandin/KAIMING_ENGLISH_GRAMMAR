object.

Modifying the subject:—
(a) He was elected president.
(b) He grew pale.

Modifying the object:—
(c) We made him president.
(d) I found him sitting alone.
(e) I made him go.

In “a” and “c” we have nn. acting as modifiers, and in “b”
and “d” we have other kinds of words—adj., participles,
etc.—acting as modifiers. The case “e” will be treated in
the following section separately.
