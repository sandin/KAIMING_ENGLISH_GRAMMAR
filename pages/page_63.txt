ADVERBS & PREPOSITIONS AS NOUNS 41
(He is nearer to us) and as a prepositional adj. (The man
near her, He is nearer us).* On the other hand, far can
never be used as a preposition (far from here, far from
it, but never far it). This shows that language is the
product of usage and not of logical deductions, and that,
in the study of grammar, our work should be based on
a careful observation of the many living facts of the
language, rather than on a foolish belief in abstract
grammatical rules.

2.51. Adverbs and Prepositions Used as Nouns.

The ups and downs (=rises and falls) of fortune or landscape.
Have a down (=prejudice or dislike) on a person.
Know all the ins and outs (=true details).
Go into whys and wherefores (=reasons) of it.
We know neither our whence nor our whither (origin and
destiny).
Compare the pros and cons (Latin prepp.=for and against).
Once is enough. For this once.
The outside. The inside. The above.

Notice also phrases like for ever, at once, before long, in
short, by far, from above, from under with the words ever,
long, etc. treated like nn. (§ 2.18).

2.52. Adverbs, Prepositions and Conjunctions.—In Eng-
lish, the parts of speech, prepositions, conjunctions and
exclamations, (and generally adverbs also), do not change
their form. Hence in these words, the change in function
does not involve a change in form.

He walked before. (adv.)
He walked before me. (prep.)
He had walked a mile before he came to the house. (conj.)
