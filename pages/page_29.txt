FORMAL AND NOTIONAL GROUPS

1.40. Formal and Notional Grouping of Grammatical Facts.—There are two ways of arranging the facts of grammar and of studying them. One is the old way, and that is to study the parts of speech one by one, first the nouns, then the pronouns, etc., and learn how each part of speech may be changed in form. Thus we study, for instance, first the changes in nouns due to gender (tiger—tigress, ox—cow), or number (child—children, mouse—mice), then the changes in pronouns due to case (he—his—him) or number (this—these, that—those), then the changes in adjectives (hot—hotter—hottest), the changes in verbs (I go, you go, he goes), etc. This way may be called the formal way of grouping grammatical facts, where we chiefly study the changes in form and their meaning. This is looking at grammar from the outside: we start from the outer form to the inner meaning, from the expression to the content.

Another and better way is to look at grammar from the inside, and start from the idea we wish to express to its expression, from inner meaning to outer form. We thus group all the grammatical means of expression according to the class of notions or ideas which they express, like number and quantity, weight and value, modification, comparison and degree, time of action, fact and fancy, relationships, etc. Under each group, we study how these ideas are expressed in English. All means of expressing the same class of notions are studied together, whether they are adjectives, adverbs, pronouns or conjunctions. Thus, under the notion of “Time,” we study all the ways of expressing time, including the tenses of the verbs (come, came, shall come), the adverbs of time
