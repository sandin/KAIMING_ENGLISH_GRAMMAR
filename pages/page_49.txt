VERBS AS NOUNS

We must face the problem squarely.
He elbowed his way into the hall.
Mr. Holmes eyed him for a moment.
The party has been well photographed.
The judge questioned the witness.

The above examples include only words which usually
serve as nn. This verbal use of regular nn. generally
comes in to help express an idea which cannot be well
expressed by the usual vbb. To “eye” a man (睨視) is to
look at him steadily for a moment with curiosity, anger, or
suspicion. To “knife” a man (暗計傷人) means also using
some underhand method to injure a person. To “doctor”
a news despatch (改竄電報) means to change many of its
words so as to deceive the reading public. To “monkey”
(要弄) with a watch is to play with it like a monkey, with
the possibility of spoiling its machine, and to “ape”
(效顰) a man means to imitate him as the ape imitates man.

Besides the above, there are of course a great many
words which commonly serve both as vbb. and nn., as a
cover, to cover up / a quick cure, to cure people / some trouble,
to trouble a person / no desire, to desire, etc.

2.30. Verbs Used as Nouns.—We have already learnt

Talking is easier than acting or To talk is easier than to act.
The form with to is called the infinitive of a vb. “In-
finitive” means “not limited”: it is so called because it
expresses a general action and does not “belong” to any
subject. It is opposed to the “finite” or limited vbb.,
