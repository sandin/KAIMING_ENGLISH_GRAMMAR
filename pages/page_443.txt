SYNOPSIS OF FORMAL GRAMMAR

By formal grammar is meant the kind of grammatical
study which concerns itself with the given forms of the lan-
guage. Formal grammar studies the classification of words,
the definitions for the different classes, the changes in form
peculiar to each class, and analysis of the sentence structure.

A purely theoretical study of the formal aspects of a lan-
guage always requires the counting of so many kinds of adj.,
adv., etc., and in order to make the system exact, arbitrary
definitions must be given to them. It is surprising, however,
how little of this formal grammar is needed by the foreign
student of the language. From the practical point of view,
the following summary should be sufficient for the average
student. References are given to sections in this book, which
discuss the respective points at greater length.
