294 ASPECTS OF ACTION

belong to one class of action, in so far as they have all one aspect in common, i.e., all the actions consist in doing something over again or in going back to some thing. The same action or actions may be classified according to different aspects. If we take the word repeat, we may look at it from another aspect, and say that it is a transitive vb. in having the action extended to some object, as repeat a song. In this aspect, repeat may be classified with other transitive vbb. like kill (a man), tell (a story), eat (some food), which are different from intransitive vbb. like go, come, rest, sleep. Thus the consideration whether an action is transitive or intransitive may be considered an aspect- notion. Again, actions may be considered as of long duration (know, remember, love) or of short duration (learn, remind, fall in love). Or an action may be active (I tell a story) or passive (I am told). There is also a distinction between habitual action (I smoke a pipe) and simple present (I am not smoking today). Thus the same action and the same vb. may belong to different “aspects” or classes. Some aspects are determined by the nature of the vb. itself (transitive—intransitive), others may depend on how it is used (active—passive) or on tense-modifications (perfect—continuous).

In every language, certain aspects of action are clearly recognized. Without making clear to oneself these aspect-notions, the proper use of the vb. will never be really understood, in spite of the clearest conjugation tables.

Take, for instance, the English distinction between I wrote and I have written. This is usually classified as a tense-distinction, but the important difference is not one
