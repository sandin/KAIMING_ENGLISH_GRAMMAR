272 COMPARISON AND DEGREE

tives are foremost, first and latest, last respectively. The positive degree is represented by regular adj. fore and late.

We can say farther than this, further than that. Farther means simply “more far,” while further means “more advanced” in a particular direction (further back in history). Notice that we say in English further to the east, further eastwards, further to the right, further up, further down (not more eastwards, more up, etc.). The proper use of further is shown below:—

I may further mention . . . .
And further (=moreover) we must remember . . . .
I shall inquire further into the question.
I shall furnish you with further details.
Shop closed until further notice.
Furthermore = moreover.

10.15. Words That Cannot Be Compared. — Certain adj. and adv. are absolute in meaning, and therefore cannot be compared. Either a thing is right or it isn’t; there can’t be one thing more right than another. We can say more correct or less correct, and more in the right, more in the wrong, but not more right or more wrong. This comes from the English sense of a sharp distinction between right and wrong, which admits of no gradations; contrast the Chinese notions 更非, 更是 (不是). Thus we have:—

是更 = more correct (not more right)
更非 = more incorrect (not more wrong)
更相同 = more similar (not more identical)
更不同 = differs more (not more different)
更與事實不符 = is farther from the truth (not more false)
