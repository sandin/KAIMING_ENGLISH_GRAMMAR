324 ASPECTS OF ACTION

I was reading (durative) upstairs, when I heard (punctual) the windows shaking, etc. (§ 11.43)

This durative-punctual aspect is also to be observed in the employment of phrases like begin to. It is more exact to say From that day, he began to lose hope, than merely he lost hope. For losing hope is a long process covering an extended period, whereas the phrase began to expresses what took place at a given point of time (that day). So also, it is more exact to say, “From the third day, the patient began to recover, than the patient recovered. The process of recovering requires an extended period of days or weeks, whereas beginning to recover could take place at any given point of time.

Only a part of the vbb. in the indefinite refer to a point of time, while all the perfect, continuous and perfect continuous tenses refer to an extended period.

11.61. Punctual and Durative Vbb.—In English, we could find many pairs of vbb. or verbal phrases expressing almost the same meaning, but belonging to different durative aspects. Thus we “got acquainted” with a person at a particular time, and then we “know” him for the rest of our days: got acquainted is punctual, while know is durative. After one once “falls in love” (punctual), then he “is in love” for a long time (durative). We may “wake a man up” in a second, but he may continue to “lie awake” for the whole night. Other examples are: get (punctual)—have (durative) / learn (p.)—know (d.) / remind (p.)—remember (d., also p.) / receive (p.)—keep (d.) / get frightened (p.)—fear (d.) / arrive (p.)—stay (d.). The vb. to be best represents the durative vbb.,
