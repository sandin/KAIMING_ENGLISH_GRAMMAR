It will be noticed that, of the two in each pair, the in-
transitive usually has a more general meaning, often
referring to a general habit or ability: drink=have the
habit of drinking wine, speak=give a speech, float=have
the ability to float, run=have the ability to run, write=be
a writer, believe=be a believer in Christianity, sing=have
the ability to sing. The transitive use, on the other
hand, is always more limited or more concrete, on account
of its being definitely associated with an object.

Note also the difference between consult a person (請教
某人) and consult with a person (與某商議) / also meet a
person (路上遇人), and meet with an accident (遇見某事; 出
事), plan meets with success (計畫成功) / know a person (認識
某人) and know of a person (聞名而未見面) / shoot a person
(槍斃), but shoot at a person or thing (向某人或某物射擊).
