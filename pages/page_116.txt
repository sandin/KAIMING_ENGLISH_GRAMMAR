94 PERSONS, THINGS AND THEIR GENDER

Lim has many systems, but no system,” the second word referring to an abstract systematic habit of doing things. Similarly, we have the following plurals, which show that they are here used to express concrete ideas:—

Impurities in the water………………impure substances.
The pleasures of an old man…………forms of pleasure.
Accused of cruelties to his wife………cruel acts.
Several possibilities exist………………possible ways.
Youthful follies ………………………foolish acts, habits.
Communication facilities………………railways, trains, boats.

4.32. A Piece of Folly, a Fit of Anger, etc.—Not all abstract nn., however, can be used to denote concrete things. Whenever in doubt, one can always use another way to express the corresponding concrete idea. We cannot talk of three furnitures, but we can always say three pieces of furniture, and we cannot speak of two infections, but we can say two cases of infection. It would seem strange to Chinese minds that we could speak of a piece of good luck (一塊福氣), but the Englishman does often use this to express a lucky event or accident. The use of piece, bit, case, form, act, etc. plus some abstract n. should be studied carefully:—

A piece of good luck, learned nonsense, folly.
Some bits of scandal, information, news.
A fit of fever, hysteria, anger.
A sudden attack of madness, fever.
Several cases of theft, malaria, typhoid, criminal neglect.
This strange form of pleasure, punishment, corruption.
His acts of kindness, cruelty, generosity.
A stroke of good fortune.
An instance (example) of his selfishness, pride, carelessness.
