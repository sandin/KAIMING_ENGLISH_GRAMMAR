SENSE OF ACTION AND QUALITY
19

The sky clears.                     The sky is clear.
Day breaks.                         It is bright
Sound frightens.                    Sound is fearful.
Prisoner escapes.                   Prisoner is free.
Master scolds.                      Master is abusive.
Servant fears.                      Servant is afraid.
Man recovers.                       Man is well.
Something hurts.                    It is painful.
Action offends.                     It is offensive.

You see with the verbs, we always feel a sense of
motion or action, while with the adjectives, we feel a sense
of quality, although the two may express the same general
idea.

Exercise 2. The teacher will give the sentences with the vbb.
and let the students try to give the corresponding sentences with the
adj. (Notice that we always use is, or some form of the verb to be,
before the adj. in the above sentences. The word be must be added
after must, will, can, etc. before adj. If to be is not used, some other
verb like feel, become, grow, get must be used in the predicate, as feel
sorry, become poor.) E.g.—

You must take care.                 You must be careful.
You have nothing to eat.            You must be (or: feel) hungry.
He has gone.                        He has been away.
Don't work too hard.                Don't be too diligent.
I shall prepare everything.         I shall be (or: get) ready.

Exercise 3. Put the proper words in the blanks before adj.—

1. I shall go soon, or I shall soon — away.
2. You must prepare, or you must — ready.
3. Has he had many things to do, or has he — busy?
4. You mustn’t forget your things, or you mustn’t — forgetful.
5. He had done too much work, and he — very tired.
6. Let us enjoy ourselves and — happy.
7. Please — more careful next time.
8. He has always — late.
9. Learn to come in time, or learn to — punctual.
