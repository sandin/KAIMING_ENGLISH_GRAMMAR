RELATIONSHIPS

15.62. The Semi-Colon.—The semi-colon is usually used to separate parallel constructions or to mark a greater division of the sentence than is indicated by the comma. The characteristic of the semi-colon is that, with it, one can begin a new clause without any conjunction. E.g.—

This was not due to carelessness; it was due to wilful neglect.

The same sentence could be written as—

This was not due to carelessness, but (it was) due to wilful neglect.

or—

This was not due to carelessness. It was due to wilful neglect.

One feels, however, that the two parallel statements are quite closely connected, and do not deserve to be separated by a full stop. The semi-colon, therefore, marks a division point between the full stop and the comma.

Where the logical relationship justifies the use of a semi-colon, it may be used even with a conj.—

This was not ideal; still, it was the best one could expect under the circumstances.

Exercise 113. Correct the following by replacing commas with semi-colons or otherwise with appropriate conj.—

1. She was sent to Shanghai without her mother’s knowledge, it was against the latter’s wish.

2. Policemen were standing in the middle of the road, they stopped the tram-cars and the buses, automobiles were searched, and all passengers were subjected to a close examination.
