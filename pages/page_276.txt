9.691. “As” as a Rel. Pron.—Besides the regular rel.
pron. who, which and that, there are two other words
which often serve in the same capacity: as and but. Both
these words can act as subjects in the rel. clause and at
the same time as conj. to connect the clause with an
antecedent. The peculiarity of these words is that they
usually go with certain other preceding words. As is
usually used in the phrases such . . . as, the same . . . as,
and as . . . as.
