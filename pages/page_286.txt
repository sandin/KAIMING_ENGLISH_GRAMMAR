15. He played the fool.

9.91. ‘I made him go.’—This requires special consideration. Here an action is predicated of the object, and we may have the following forms:—

(a) The action may be passive from the point of view of the object, as—

Have the shoes repaired.
Have the letter mailed.
Have the linen sent out to be washed.
Have a doctor sent for.
I want to see the building finished.
I would rather see you damned first. (An impolite form of refusal)
Keep the money locked in the safe.

These all suggest or indicate something to be done to the object. Hence the past participle is used.

(b) The action may be active from the point of view of the object, in which case the vb. expressing it is put in the infinitive. After the vbb. make, let, see and hear, the to of the infinitive is regularly dropped; after help and bid, it is sometimes dropped and sometimes retained; after all other words, like ask, allow, want, command, urge, request, etc., it is always expressed.

(I) I made him go.
I saw him go up the stairs.
I heard him say (not said) that Mr. Liu was ill.
Why not let him go?
Let me pass.
Make him wait outside (pay for it).
