(1) Nouns............dog, book, table, school, John, China, water, sound,
work, idea, kindness, strength, anger, danger,
order.
(2) Pronouns........I, you, he, her, who, this, those, which.
(3) Verbs.............cut, strike, see, think, breathe, feel, know, grow,
be, become, must, will, dare.
(4) Adjectives.......good, bad, rot, red, lazy, kind, strong, angry, dan-
gerous, orderly.
(5) Adverbs..........how, when, why, where, well, poorly, now, never,
soon, suddenly, here, already.
(6) Prepositions...in, out, above, under, against, toward, with, with-
out, at, during, by.
(7) Conjunctions..and, or, because, although, unless, since, both...and,
if, then, while.
(8) Exclamations..oh! what! ah! there! look! heavens! fire! help! my
purse! what a liar!

The above are the so-called Parts of Speech, or eight
grammatical classes of words. A part of speech simply
means a class of words. There are classes of words, just
as there are classes of animals or plants. Thus the
words dog, look, China belong to one class, and cut, strike,
breathe belong to another, just as we put rats, rabbits and
squirrels in one class, and dogs, wolves and foxes in
another.
