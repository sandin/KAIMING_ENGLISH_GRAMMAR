NOTES. (1) Hanged as past and p.p. is used in the sense of "hanging a man to death;" hung is used in the other senses.
(2) Sung and sprung are not in modern use for past tense.
(3) The auxiliaries can, may, will and shall have only two forms (present and past, but no p.p.). These will be studied in § 13.60.

(c) Finally we have vbb. which have three forms in the three principal parts. With the exception of the words begin and swim (which are nearer the words in “b”), these vbb. are always distinguished by the fact that they have their p.p. ending in -n.
