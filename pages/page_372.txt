TIME OF ACTION

As a way of expressing future obligation, is to is often more useful than shall. Even in commands, You are to hand in the exercises next Monday is as often used as You shall hand in, etc. Where several subjects are designated, is to is probably more convenient than shall: The first year students are to enter first, and the second year students are to follow them (instead of students shall, etc.). Also in stating that something was going to take place in some past time (after-past), was to, instead of should, is the correct expression. The ship was to arrive that afternoon (not ship should) means that the ship had not yet arrived at that past time, but was going to arrive.

Exercise 103. Translate the following from Chinese into English:—

1. 明天也許他不在家。
2. 也許明天他不見了，這是很可能的事。
3. 這齣戲 (play) 成功不成功不一定。
4. 子路應在前走，子貢應跟着他。
5. 我就走了，因為我還要去看幾位朋友。（過去）
6. 那天下午正要開學。
7. 你們一聽號角 (whistle)，就得齊集操場 (playground) 上。

13.34. Present Used for Future.—In English, the present is used for expressing future action under two circumstances. First, the vbb. expressing the idea of “going” or “moving” are often used this way. Thus for I shall come, we simply say I am coming (tomorrow or next week), and not I am going to come. I am going and I am coming therefore really express future action (compare I am thinking, I am working now). Further examples are:—

I leave tomorrow for Peiping.
The ship sails next Saturday.
He starts this afternoon.
