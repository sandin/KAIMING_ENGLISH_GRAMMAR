3.45. English Reticence and Double Negatives.—The
English are a reticent nation, and they have reserved
forms of saying things which in other languages might be
expressed by rather strong advv. Not half bad is what
Americans would express by Isn't that lovely?, Isn't it
grand? or what a Frenchman would express by ravissant
(ravishing, delightful), and is the equivalent of Chinese
hao chi la (好極了). According to a great authority on the
English language, She is rather good-looking (literally, 還好
看) is the strongest praise you can draw from an English-
man for a woman's looks. And where a Frenchman
would say extremely or infinitely (extrêmement, infiniment),
an Englishman says only very or rather or pretty.*
