Sequence, Alternation and Distribution

8.50. Sequence: the Ordinals.—The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. are called “cardinals,” while the numbers of sequence 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. are called “ordinals” in grammar. From the fourth on, the following numbers always take a th, except numbers with “one,” “two,” “three” which still keep the first, second and third. Eighth has only one t, ninth is spelt with the e in nine omitted, and twelveth becomes twelfth. Thus—

fifth          twelfth         fiftieth
eighth         thirteenth      forty-first
ninth          hundredth       eighty-second
tenth          thousandth      seventy-third
eleventh       fortieth        hundred and first

Notice also that we say—

Number one, but: the first one.
Number two, but: the second one.
Book one,     but: the first book.
Volume two, but: the second volume.

It is more common to use “No.” with the bigger numbers, thus “prisoner No. 1075,” “seat No. C 75,” etc.

These ordinals form advv. by having -ly added to them, thus firstly, secondly, thirdly, lastly, etc. But first and last can otherwise be used as advv. also, as He came first, I came last, Last came the cripple.

Some special uses of these sequence words are shown in the following examples:—
