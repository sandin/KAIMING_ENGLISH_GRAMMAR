2.42. Adjectives Changed into Adverbs: the Ending -ly.—In English, adj. are changed into adv. generally by adding -ly. Thus we say complete ignorance (adj.—n.), but completely ignorant (adv.—adj.); unusual luck (adj.—n.) but unusually lucky (adv.—adj.). We also say beautiful singing, but She sings beautifully. Thus the ending -ly becomes a general sign for adv. (compare, however, §2.22, man—manly, etc.). The student should remember to make this change when using such adverb modifiers. A good writer¹ generally knows how to use his adv. Compare the following:—

Adj. + Nn.                           Adv. + Adj.
fearful dirt                          fearfully dirty
awful noise                           awfully noisy
total ignorance                       totally ignorant
sudden illness                        suddenly ill
great surprise                        greatly surprised
unspeakable joy                       unspeakably joyful
supreme happiness                     supremely happy
