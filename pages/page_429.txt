The people were taxed to death and bled white by the "re-
volutionary" (?!) generals.
Mr. Henderson continued "We cannot let the unemployment
question alone, because the question will not let us alone."
(Hear! Hear!) (In this newspaper report, the "Hear! Hear!"
indicates the applause of the audience at Mr. Henderson's

Loose and Periodic Sentences

15.70. Loose and Periodic Sentence Structure.—Com-
pare the following groups of sentences:—

(A) Loose Sentences—

The dinner is at eight, if I am not mistaken.
He writes fairly well, although he is a little inclined to
use long words.

(B) Periodic Sentences—

If I am not mistaken, the dinner is at eight.
Although he is a little inclined to use long words he,
writes fairly well.

In group "A," the dependent clauses stand at the end,
while in group "B," they stand at the beginning. Al-
though the contents of the sentences are the same, the
stylistic effect is quite different. In the first sentence,
the speaker intends to say "the dinner is at eight," where
the sentence could very well stop, but "if am not mis-
taken" is added as an after-thought. In group "B," the
same sentence is conceived as a whole from the beginning.
Hence the first type (called "the loose sentence") is more
informal, more natural and less pretentious, while the
second type (called "the periodic sentences") is more
