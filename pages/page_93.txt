3.63. Tonal Interrogation and the Questioning Tone.—
Another form of question usually expressing surprise is
to keep the usual form of the affirmative or negative
sentence, and give it a rising questioning tone at the end
of the sentence. The president has resigned? (with ris-
ing tone) implies some surprise at the news. In other
cases, it shows only an attentive or affectionate attitude.
Yes? or Well? means go ahead and tell me what you are
going to say. Oh, papa, you are going to buy me a sailing
boat? Really? Yes? No? is a form of asking that is difficult
to resist.

In English questions, the tone generally rises toward
the end. Are you there? is pronounced are (low) you
(highest) there (starting low and gradually rising).
There are some exceptions, however. First, in questions
with interrogative words, like What is it all about? the
tone at the end drops as in other statements. Secondly,
questions ending with an or not keep the rising tone until
the last or not, when the tone drops: Will you pay me or
not? Thirdly, statements followed by a tag-question
have the usual dropping tone of other statements, while
the tag-question itself has the regular questioning tone.

I. What do you want (drop)?
II. Do you want anything (rising)?
