But even in some compound sentences, we can distinguish between main and dependent clauses. In He came, but I went, both clauses are evidently of equal importance, and there is no main or dependent clause. But in He would come, if I would go, clearly the first clause (He would come) is the main statement, and if I would go describes only a condition of his coming. The second clause is therefore felt to be of less importance or lower rank than the first. Thus we can have a main clause and a dependent clause even in a compound sentence.

In such compound sentences, just what clause is considered main or dependent, and whether the two clauses are of equal or unequal importance depends entirely on the meaning. It cannot be judged from the grammatical form. Conj. like and, both, either . . . or, but, as well as,
