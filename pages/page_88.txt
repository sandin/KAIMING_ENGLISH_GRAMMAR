SENTENCE MOODS

Exercise 23. Make sentences with some of the above phrases.
Sometimes an obviously untrue question is used for
negation, as—
He a gentleman? (What nonsense that is!)
Am I my brother's keeper? (Is that my duty?)
Chang failed in mathematics? (Chang is the best student in
mathematics.)
Chiang an honest man? (You know jolly well he isn't.)
Can the Dragon King be short of treasures? (He is famous for
his treasures.)

Some apparently affirmative sentences have really a negative force, especially the common I should worry, meaning
What do I care? (That does not worry me). Catch me going
to the church also implies that you will never find me
there. This is similar to the Chinese 你聽他話的 (literally, You listen to that fellow’s words), meaning Don’t believe
what he says, or 我怕他! (literally, I afraid of him!), meaning I am not afraid.

3.56. “I ain’t got nothing.”—In English vulgar speech,
it is quite common to hear expressions like I ain’t got
nothing, I don’t never want no help from nobody, He can’t do
nothing without my help. It would seem that the meaning
from the combination of two negatives would be positive
or affirmative, but actually this is only an English way
of emphasizing the negative. He can’t do nothing really
means He can do nothing. In repeating these negatives, the
speaker is only taking pains to make his negative meaning clear and unmistakable, for fear that one negative
alone might not be heard.* This use of repeated negatives is not allowed in the speech of higher-class society.
