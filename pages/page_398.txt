FACT AND FANCY

if he should come / if he should be / if he should have). Because they are out of the way, the usual grammars pay more attention to them than is necessary. Such forms may be considered as the equivalents of the forms if he should come, with the should omitted. That is to say, whenever such forms occur, it is always possible to insert the word should in it. For example,—

If it be said that, etc.=if it should be said that, etc.
Although it be the last thing I desire=although it should be, etc.
Lest he hear about it=lest he should hear, etc.
Suppose that he return you the money=suppose he should return you, etc.
The court ordered that he leave the city at once, or that he be hanged to death=the court ordered that he should leave, etc., or that he should be hanged.
He agreed to go, on the condition that his family expenses be (=should be) well provided for.
The widow was bequeathed the whole estate, provided she remain (=should remain) unmarried.
