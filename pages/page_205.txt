DISTINCTION
183

This is the same one that you saw yesterday.
This is the same one as that (one).
I eat the same food that you eat.
My food is the same as yours.
You are the same age as my sister.
Wealth or poverty is all the same (or just the same) to me. (As adj.)
But I thank you all the same (or just the same). (As adv.)

It is always best to use that when a clause follows
(i.e., with a vb. expressed), and use as when a simple n.
or pron. follows (i.e., when there is no vb. following, or
when the vb. is understood).

When there is a vb. with the idea of sharing, we may
use with, as—

I live in the same room with him. (= I share a room with him.)

The use of another, the other and others follows the
usage regarding the use or omission of a and the.

A boy.                 Another boy.           (Indefinite sing.)
Boys.                  Others.                (Indefinite pl.)
The boy(s).            The other(s).          (Definite sing. or pl.)

Another is simply a compound word formed by an and
other. We may say, also, some other boy or boys, any other
boy(s) and no other boy(s), as we say some boy(s), any
boy(s) and no boy(s). No other is followed by than, but
different, differ are followed by from, e.g.—

This is no other than the one we saw yesterday.
It can be no other person than Mr. Ma himself.
This is different from the one we saw.

Exercise 57. Study the following and find out why the words
another, the other, others, the others and the words as, that, with, than
are used. Then make some sentences with the same as, the same that,
another, some other, any other, others, no other than, etc.
