learn the abstract notions of English nouns. Compared with the Chinese, English abounds in abstract words. Thus, we have nien-ling (年齡, year-year) for “age,” but the abstract idea of “size” is expressed by the more concrete words ta-hsiao (大小, big-small). The ending hsing (性) for abstract nn., as in shen-shu-hsing (伸縮性, extend-shrink-character, “elasticity”), k'o-fên-hsing (可分性, may-divide-character, “divisibility”), is a modern innovation of very recent date, due to western influence.

This is often as difficult for the Chinese students to grasp as it is well-nigh impossible for most people to distinguish between the church (concrete) and religion (abstract). They would never think it possible for Jesus to stand outside the church window, calling to the young worshippers inside, “Suffer the little children to come unto me.”

In the following, we use italics to indicate abstract ideas and bold face to indicate concrete ones.
