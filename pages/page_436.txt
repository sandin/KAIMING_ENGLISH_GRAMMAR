414 ECONOMY OF EXPRESSION

The relative pron. that is also dropped when used as an object (§ 9.68):—

The man (that) you saw.
He was not the man (that) I wanted.
He was the one (that) you were asking for.
The things we have are not the things we want, and the things
    we want are not the things we have.

The tendency to shorten dependent clauses has also
brought about the use of words like as and but as relative
pron.—
He came to apologize, as was expected.
Anyway, he lost his job, as has been mentioned above.
There is no one but admires his courage.

16.33. “And that.”—In English, the phrase “and that” may stand for a whole preceding clause. E.g.—
The poor boy was ordered to go out and fetch water, and that
    (i.e., go out and fetch water) on a stormy night like this.
You had better pay up, and that (pay up) immediately.

Abbreviations and Contractions

16.40. Contractions.—The contracted forms like isn’t,
aren’t, won’t, wouldn’t, shan’t, can’t, are so common that they
are part of the daily language. In fact, they have become
the regular colloquial forms, so much so that when an
Englishman says I shall not or I cannot, it suggests a
slight emphasis on not. Actually, the word not is always
pronounced full [not] and never [net], so that there is no
way of pronouncing this not except either with a clear
vowel or contracted as indicated.
