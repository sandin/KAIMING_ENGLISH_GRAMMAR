268 COMPARISON AND DEGREE

Sometimes it is possible to use the words more and most. Thus sound, sounder, soundest is always correct, but we sometimes say, “This is a more sound proposition.”

(2) Words of two syllables sometimes take “-er” and “-est” and sometimes “more” and “most.” E.g.—

clever          narrow          happy          lovely
cleverer        narrower        happier        lovelier
cleverest       narrowest       happiest       loveliest

stupid          cunning         learned
more stupid     more cunning    more learned
most stupid     most cunning    most learned

There are no clear rules for this difference, except established usage and a vague sense of euphony, which is again based on usage. Thus we have cleverer, cleverest, but more proper, most proper, and not properer, properest. We might say handsomer or more handsome, and commoner or more common, but we could never say cunninger or learneder or honester. The -y ending seems always to go well with the -er and -est, as dirtier, healthier, crazier, lazier, funnier (but usually more sticky and not stickier). The only comparatively clear rule seems to be that the endings -able, -ible, -ful, -ing can never take on the -er, -est additions. Thus formations like laughabler, awfuller, cunninger are practically unknown in English. Advv. in -ly (except early) always have “more” and “most,” as more rarely, most surely.

(3) Words of three or more syllables generally take “more” and “most,” and only rarely -er, -est. E.g.—

beautiful       convenient      interesting
more beautiful  more convenient more interesting
most beautiful  most convenient most interesting
