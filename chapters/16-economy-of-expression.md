## CHAPTER XVI ECONOMY OF EXPRESSION

### 16.10. Ease and Economy

Proficiency in any language means a certain ease in handling its sentence forms and constructions. The foreign student is apt to err on the side of stiffness and over-correctness of expression. He says, for instance, “you must not” instead of “you mustn’t,” and “if it is possible” instead of “if possible.” These simpler forms, however, are used to a very large extent by the native speakers, for every language has naturally evolved certain omissions and short cuts which make for ease and economy. The English language, in particular, is marked by its love of economy and simplicity of construction, for the Englishman does not use more words than is strictly necessary for his purpose. It is therefore very appropriate that we should conclude our study of English grammar with a review of its various word-saving and energy-saving devices.

### 16.20. Shifting of Function

A noun generally makes for simpler and shorter sentences than other parts of speech. Compare the following sentences:

- I saw hatred in his eyes. Or: His eyes seemed to show hatred.
- His eyes seem to show that he hated me.
- I have no fear of his running away.
- I am not afraid that he may run away.
- Cleanliness is next to holiness.
- To be clean is next in importance to to be holy. (A bad sentence)
- There's comfort for one's soul in smoking.
- When one smokes, one's soul feels comforted. (A bad sentence)
- Strive for simplicity of style.
- Strive to be simple when you write.
- Punctuality often means a waste of time in China.
- To be punctual in China means that you often have to waste your time waiting for others.
- He makes a virtue of necessity.
- Because he has to do it, he is making it appear that he loves doing it.

In all the above pairs of sentences, it is easily seen that the first example is neater, shorter, and on the whole a much better sentence than the second example.

### 16.21. Change of Clauses into Phrases

In consequence of the relative simplicity of nouns and complexity of finite verbs (which entail with them a subject and perhaps an object), phrases which are without a verb and subject are shorter and neater than clauses. This is especially true of prepositional phrases. The two words for fun can stand for he was not serious in, and the two words by necessity can take the place of the clause because he had to do it. Do it by turn is much shorter than You do it first and the others will do it one after another. During his absence is shorter than while he was away. In English, there are many pairs of prepositions and conjunctions which have the same meaning.

| Prepositions | Conjunctions |
|-------------|-------------|
| on account of his illness or because of illness | because he was ill |
| during his illness | while he was ill |
| against, despite, in spite of my advice | although I advised him to the contrary |
| for all my trouble, with all your trouble | although I (you) took so much trouble |
| for the purpose of, by way of, with a view to | in order that, so that, that |
| out of gratefulness, jealousy | because one felt grateful, jealous |
| with that, he went away | after he said that, he, etc. |
| with your permission | if you allow me |
| to my surprise | (I was surprised to) |
| upon seeing me there | when he saw me there |
| on hearing this | when he heard this |
| but for my help | if I had not helped him |
| like me | as I do it |
| after examination | after it was examined |
| before coming | before one came |
| since his departure | since he left |

Many verbs and adjectives may be followed by a prepositional phrase, an infinitive phrase or by a clause beginning with that.

- I am sure of his coming.
- I am sure to meet him.
- I am sure that he will come.
- He is afraid of death.
- He is afraid to die.
- He is afraid that he may die.
- He is thinking of going home.
- He is thinking to go home.
- He is thinking that he must go home.
- I am sorry for you.
- I am sorry to hear this.
- I am sorry that the letter didn't reach you.
- He was disappointed at their attitude.
- He was disappointed to hear that they did not care.
- He was disappointed that they took no interest in it.

### 16.22. Change of Phrase-Modifiers into Word-Modifiers

Many phrases are used as modifiers and can be converted into word-modifiers. Thus, instead of saying “We are living in a China torn by civil wars,” one might write more simply “We are living in a war-torn China.” “If you go through the famine-stricken district” is simpler and better than “if you go through the district stricken by famine.” How such modifiers are formed has already been fully explained under § 9.26.

### 16.30. Dropping of Auxiliary Words

A few examples should suffice here:

- They had come and (had) gone.
- He had inherited and (had) spent a fortune.
- She was trying to start a ball, and he (was trying) to prevent it.
- She was trying to get into society, and he (was trying) to get away from it.

### 16.31. Dropping of Principal Words

This kind of ellipsis is especially common in answers to questions.

- Would you join? I should love to (join you).
- I should like to fry chicken or bake potatoes, but do not know how (to do it).
- He has declared bankruptcy. You don’t tell me (that this is true)!
- Would you speak at the next meeting? I would rather not (do that).
- Will you come? I think (I will) not.
- Why the hurry? (Why should there be such a hurry?)
- Why so? (Why is it so?)
- But how? (But how to do it?)
- How now? (How is it now?)
- What next? (What is to come next?)
- What about? (What is it about?)
- May I telephone to him now? You might just as well (do so).
- Is that correct? In a way (it is).
- Does he write poetry? Not any that I know of.
- Did you know of this? Not until now.
- (Do it) Gently, please.
- (That’s) Enough! (That’s) Impossible!
- He comes from the same place (as I do).
- I went to Enfield’s (house or shop).

### 16.32. Ellipsis in Dependent Clauses

Dependent clauses are often subject to all sorts of mutilations in English (see § 9.82).

- I’ll come, if (it is) possible.
- Wash it in water, pick out the small particles, if (there’s) any, and sun it in the air. Take it in, when (it is) dry. Replace it, if (it is) necessary.
- (When) Dinner (was) over, the ceremony was begun.
- I will bring her up all alone, (if) God (be) willing.
- You should come when (you are) called.
- When (you are) writing your mother, give her my warmest regards.
- When (you are) in doubt, consult the dictionary.
- Although (he was) the youngest of the class, he captured all the prizes.

Note also the frequent dropping of that in clauses:

- He said (that) he was coming.
- I saw (that) he could not do it.
- He said (that) he had received word (that) Millie was not coming.

The relative pronoun that is also dropped when used as an object (§ 9.68):

- The man (that) you saw.
- He was not the man (that) I wanted.
- He was the one (that) you were asking for.
- The things we have are not the things we want, and the things we want are not the things we have.

The tendency to shorten dependent clauses has also brought about the use of words like as and but as relative pronouns:

- He came to apologize, as was expected.
- Anyway, he lost his job, as has been mentioned above.
- There is no one but admires his courage.

### 16.33. “And that”

In English, the phrase “and that” may stand for a whole preceding clause. E.g.:

- The poor boy was ordered to go out and fetch water, and that (i.e., go out and fetch water) on a stormy night like this.
- You had better pay up, and that (pay up) immediately.

### 16.40. Abbreviations and Contractions

The contracted forms like isn’t, aren’t, won’t, wouldn’t, shan’t, can’t, are so common that they are part of the daily language. In fact, they have become the regular colloquial forms, so much so that when an Englishman says I shall not or I cannot, it suggests a slight emphasis on not. Actually, the word not is always pronounced full [not] and never [net], so that there is no way of pronouncing this not except either with a clear vowel or contracted as indicated.

In questions especially, the forms Are you not coming? or Can he not go himself? are more rarely used than Aren't you coming? and Can't he go himself? Do ... not in questions is still rarer. One very rarely says Do you not think so? or Does he not come here everyday?, but uses forms with don't you and doesn't he. No student, therefore, can expect to speak English properly and idiomatically without mastering these forms (§ 3.51).

The use of don't for the third person singular present has never yet been countenanced by grammar books. Actually, he don't is extremely common today, even in lectures by Columbia University professors, for instance. The underlying reason is the unconscious desire for economy, for doesn't consists of two syllables, while don't consists of only one. That don't matter is certainly easier to pronounce than That doesn't matter. However, it is not for the Chinese students of English to be pioneers in English grammar reform.

### 16.41. Abbreviations

Abbreviations have also become a part of the English daily language. Ordinarily, one says auto and not automobile, taxi and not taxi-cab, co-ed and not co-education, movie and talkie and not moving picture and talking picture, 'phone instead of telephone, cinema instead of cinematograph, and exam instead of examination. An advertisement is referred to as an ad, and an omnibus is just a bus. The Elevated Railways in New York is progressively abbreviated thus: elevated—el.—L. In current English, one also speaks of “T.B.” (tuberculosis), “O.K.” (meaning “all right,” and traced to excellent wines made in Aux Cayes in Santo Domingo, later used for anything that is of the right standard), "C.O.D." (cash on delivery by post), "C.P." (Communist Party), "B.A.T." (British American Tobacco Co.), etc.

### 16.42. Monosyllabism

The same desire for brevity is seen in another tendency to substitute short words for long ones, especially in current American slang. Below are some examples (the specifically American or English slang words are indicated):

- **cop**: copper = policeman
- **thug**: gangster
- **buck**: dollar, as in “three bucks” (Am.)
- **guy**: fellow (Am.)
- **chap**: fellow (Eng.)
- **kid**: child
- **grub**: food, feed (Eng.)
- **bite, snack**: a light lunch
- **grit**: endurance
- **guts**: real value, inner force
- **swop**: change
- **fake**: forgery, anything false
- **fad, craze**: fashion
- **crib**: plagiarize
- **cram**: work hard before examination
- **grab**: take by force
- **lot**: amount
- **hike**: make an excursion on foot
- **probe**: investigation
- **boss, chief**: manager or president
- **date**: appointment with girls
- **lift**: elevator
- **sack**: “give, get the sack” = dismiss, be dismissed
- **pop**: papa
- **mom**: mamma
- **kick**: protest (“raise a kick”)
- **row**: quarrel (“raise, make a row”)
- **push**: aggressive or enterprising spirit
- **fit**: in good health (Eng.)
- **deal**: business transaction
- **job, post**: position
- **dough**: money (Am.)
- **tip**: suggestion (“give you a tip”)
- **clue**: suggestive evidence
- **off**: finished, over
- **through**: “am through with you” = will have no more to do with you
- **up**: has come up (“What is up?” “subject is up for discussion”)
- **play**: drama
- **broke**: bankrupt
- **bum**: penniless loafer

A very long list could be drawn up of these monosyllabic words, but the above, some of which are in literary use, should suffice. Notice also such truly monosyllabic combinations, which approach very nearly the Chinese:

- **stand pat**: remain firm in one's attitude
- **wash-out**: a complete failure
- **lock-out**: exclusion of workers as employer's method against strikes
- **try-out**: preliminary test
- **tight-wad**: stingy person
- **soul-mate**: lover
- **dumb-bell, bone-head**: fool
- **love-nest**: lover's home
- **old man**: husband, father
- **joy-ride**: pleasure trip or drive
- **high-brow**: high class, high and fine
- **give-and-take**: exchange of service or favour
- **frame-up**: trick to involve persons with the police

The actual prevalence of monosyllabism in current American can only be fully appreciated from the following examples, where whole sentences or phrases consist of monosyllabic words. E.g., She got into a fit (=rage) / You've got to hand it to him (=acknowledge his superiority or cleverness) / Knock some sense into that guy (=make him realize his situation) / He was the best guy to put over a deal (=a business transaction) / I take off my hat to him (=acknowledge his cleverness) / What a guy wants is a lot of push and grit that will keep him on the go and not see red or fall flat and get scared when some one shoots a pop-gun at you.

### 16.50. Mottoes

Mottoes, in order to be effective and easily remembered, must be brief. Hence we find some English mottoes expressing a whole philosophy or belief with the brevity of Chinese grammar, in which all unnecessary words are done away with. When the Chinese say “Sit eat mountain empty” (坐喫山空), he conveys his idea just as clearly and much more picturesquely than a long sentence such as “If you do nothing but eat, even a fortune as big as the mountain will be gone some day.” Below are a few examples:

- Easier said than done. (Notice that, strictly, more easily should be used.)
- First come, first served.
- Once bitten, twice shy.
- Once a thief, always a thief.
- No work, no pay.
- Well begun, half done.

### 16.60. Economy and Emotional Language

It is natural that under the stress of emotion, one says what is uppermost in his mind, because one has no time for grammatical perfection. That does not mean such exclamations are not grammatical or less effective. The grammatical peculiarities of exclamations have been mentioned in § 3.80. A few examples here will show many omissions natural in such exclamations: Hands off! / Hats off! / My purse! / Me a burglar? / Pretty, isn’t it? / Best food I’ve ever tasted! / He married?! / Quick—the doctor!

### 16.70. Economy and Business

There are many occasions when economy is needed for practical reasons, such as in writing cable messages, newspaper heads, advertisements, sign-posts and hoardings. When a man sends a cable “man in hospital doctor confident remit money,” no one will criticize him for his grammar. In the other cases, such as advertisements and news heads, the great consideration is for effectiveness, brevity and force. It is by force of suggestion, rather than by wordy statements, that customers are persuaded to buy the goods. Hence we find some of the best advertisement lines are brief and impactful.
