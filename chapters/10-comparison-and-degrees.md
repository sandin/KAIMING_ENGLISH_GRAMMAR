## CHAPTER X: COMPARISON AND DEGREES

### 10.10. The Degrees of Comparison: The Relative Nature

In English grammar, the usually recognized “degrees of comparison” of adjj. and advv. are three: positive, comparative and superlative, as represented by old, older, oldest, or good, better, best. Now these three degrees, it should be clearly understood, only refer to the formal endings, -er and -est, as regards the change in word-form; in no way do they exhaust the possible degrees of comparison in language, as regards its logical content. Logically, there should be at least five degrees, namely, old, older, oldest, less old and least old. Thus we have:—

stupid—{ more stupid—most stupid  
         { less stupid—least stupid

Moreover, there are all sorts of words expressing indeterminate degrees, such as extremely, somewhat, more or less, in the actual language. These words are used, not for comparison among several objects, but for indicating degrees in a general way, as somewhat in “somewhat tired,” or with reference to some assumed standard, as too in too old for her, with her as the standard. In this grammar, all such expressions and their use will be studied, because they are all means of expressing the notion of degree.

It should also be noted that the comparative and superlative degrees are used only for comparison among several objects. A “better” man than Al Capone (American gangster) is not necessarily a “good” man, and a “more honest” man than the Minister of Communications may not be a really “honest” man at all. This student is “older” than that student, comparatively speaking, but, absolutely speaking, neither of them is really “old.” So the positive degree (old) is really absolute, while the comparative and superlative degrees (older, oldest) are relative.

Thus we come to the conclusion that the “better” man is not better than the “good” man, and we shall find also the “best” man is not really better than the “better” man. The “best” man is simply “better” than all the rest. If A is thirteen, B is twelve and C is eleven, then, clearly, A is only older than B and C, although he the oldest. And then A really is not “old” at all.

### 10.11. The “Three Degrees of Comparison”

In English, we have the endings -er and -est for the comparative and superlative degrees, as in older, oldest, while there are no special endings to indicate the degrees expressed by less old and least old, which are often expressed by younger and youngest. Moreover, the longer words do not admit such endings, but are used with more and most. The general rules are:—

(1) Words of one syllable can always have “-er” and “-est.” E.g.—  
great          broad          new          deep  
greater        broader        newer        deeper  
greatest       broadest       newest       deepest

Sometimes it is possible to use the words more and most. Thus sound, sounder, soundest is always correct, but we sometimes say, “This is a more sound proposition.”

(2) Words of two syllables sometimes take “-er” and “-est” and sometimes “more” and “most.” E.g.—  
clever          narrow          happy          lovely  
cleverer        narrower        happier        lovelier  
cleverest       narrowest       happiest       loveliest

stupid          cunning         learned  
more stupid     more cunning    more learned  
most stupid     most cunning    most learned

There are no clear rules for this difference, except established usage and a vague sense of euphony, which is again based on usage. Thus we have cleverer, cleverest, but more proper, most proper, and not properer, properest. We might say handsomer or more handsome, and commoner or more common, but we could never say cunninger or learneder or honester. The -y ending seems always to go well with the -er and -est, as dirtier, healthier, crazier, lazier, funnier (but usually more sticky and not stickier). The only comparatively clear rule seems to be that the endings -able, -ible, -ful, -ing can never take on the -er, -est additions. Thus formations like laughabler, awfuller, cunninger are practically unknown in English. Advv. in -ly (except early) always have “more” and “most,” as more rarely, most surely.

(3) Words of three or more syllables generally take “more” and “most,” and only rarely -er, -est. E.g.—  
beautiful       convenient      interesting  
more beautiful  more convenient more interesting  
most beautiful  most convenient most interesting

generous        incomplete      comprehensive  
more generous   more incomplete more comprehensive  
most generous   most incomplete most comprehensive

Exceptionally, however, we do sometimes use -er and -est for emphasis, e.g., “This is the confoundedest problem I ever came across,” which is more expressive than most confounded. Such cases are really abnormal deviations from the regular rule for some special reasons of rhetoric.

NOTE.—When we add the ending -er or -est to words ending in -y, we change the y into i, when it follows a consonant, but keep it unchanged, if it follows a vowel: thus, happier, lazier, clumsier, but gayer, coyer. Phonetically, gayer retains the original “long a” sound, which is not lowered as in prayer (=禱文): gayer rhymes with layer (n.), and not with mayor, prayer, there, care. A single final consonant preceded by a single vowel is doubled when -er or -est is added to it: thus thinner, fatter, but quicker and cheaper.

### 10.12. “More Better,” “Next Best,” etc.

Two cases are worthy of special mention. In vulgar speech, and among Chinese students, the phrase “more better” is often used. This is not in accordance with good usage, although it can be found in Shakespeare, who also gives us “the most unkindest cut of all.” The psychological reason for this mistake is the desire for clearness and emphasis.

On the other hand, the expressions “next best,” “second best,” “third best” are perfectly good and very convenient forms of expression, equivalent to Chinese 第二好, 第三好. English has also the expression the largest but one (two, three) equivalent to Chinese 第二大 (第三, 第四大) respectively.

For emphasis, we have the expressions, the very best, the very worst, the very first and the very last. The word possible is also often added to a superlative in -est to emphasize its meaning:—

the best possible man for the job  
the worst possible combination of fools and knaves  
by the quickest possible route  
at the earliest possible opportunity  
make the greatest possible allowance

### 10.13. Superiority, Equality and Inferiority

From §10.10 that a more logical division of the degrees of comparison should be on the basis of equality or inequality, as suggested by Jespersen. On this basis, we should have the three degrees:—

1. (>) older than . . . . . . . . (Superiority)  
2. (=) as old as . . . . . . . . . (Equality)  
3. (<) less old than . . . . . . . (Inferiority)

Notice that in expressing equality, we use the conj. phrase as . . . as, but in expressing superiority or inferiority, we use the conj. than. Instead of the pair as . . . as, so . . . as may also be used. Moreover, we can put in a n. between the pair, as well as between -er . . . than. E.g.—

He is as good a player as Morley.  
He is a better player than Morley.

Very often, especially in the colloquial style, the phrase introduced by than or as is dropped as being understood.

But this will do just as well (as that one).  
It is even better (than that one).  
Are they as keen about it (as we are here)?  
But this is just as good an opportunity.  
I don’t think you can find a better substitute.  
Oh, no, he is not as (stressed) old, but older.

Exercise 87. Change the following sentences, using the conjn. as . . . as, or -er (more) . . . than, with a n. in between.

1. Mr Harding and his wife are equally great gamblers.  
2. In playing chess, Flexner is better than Harris.  
3. Your correction and the original sentence are equally bad.  
4. He and Hopkins are equally fast writers.  
5. Hopkins does not write as fast as Murry.

The Latin comparatives superior, inferior, prior, senior, junior are followed by to and not by than, e.g., prior to this event, superior to him in business ability.

For other than, see §8.20.

### 10.14. Implied Comparison

There are a few adj. which are used only in the comparative and superlative degrees, and which cannot be followed by than. These are all words denoting direction: inner, outer, nether, upper, and innermost, outermost (outmost, utmost), nethermost (rare), uppermost. We say the inner circle or the outer circle, but cannot say “This circle is outer than that one.” The comparison is implied. Notice that the words in the positive degree for these adj. are all prepp. or advv.—in, out, beneath, up.

Former and latter also cannot be followed by than: the former president, the latter half, but never former than or latter than. Latter refers to what comes behind in space, while later refers to what comes behind in time: the latter half of the book, but the later period. The superlatives are foremost, first and latest, last respectively. The positive degree is represented by regular adj. fore and late.

We can say farther than this, further than that. Farther means simply “more far,” while further means “more advanced” in a particular direction (further back in history). Notice that we say in English further to the east, further eastwards, further to the right, further up, further down (not more eastwards, more up, etc.). The proper use of further is shown below:—

I may further mention . . . .  
And further (=moreover) we must remember . . . .  
I shall inquire further into the question.  
I shall furnish you with further details.  
Shop closed until further notice.  
Furthermore = moreover.

### 10.15. Words That Cannot Be Compared

Certain adj. and adv. are absolute in meaning, and therefore cannot be compared. Either a thing is right or it isn’t; there can’t be one thing more right than another. We can say more correct or less correct, and more in the right, more in the wrong, but not more right or more wrong. This comes from the English sense of a sharp distinction between right and wrong, which admits of no gradations; contrast the Chinese notions 更非, 更是 (不是). Thus we have:—

是更 = more correct (not more right)  
更非 = more incorrect (not more wrong)  
更相同 = more similar (not more identical)  
更不同 = differs more (not more different)  
更與事實不符 = is farther from the truth (not more false)

Other adjj. which do not admit of comparison both in Chinese and English, do not require special caution. One dead body, for instance, cannot be deader than the rest, nor can one piece of ice be more frozen than another.

On the other hand, we have in English certain comparative forms which do not easily admit of translation into Chinese. In both languages, we can say, of course, that one is more patriotic than the other. But in English, we can even say he is more of a patriot than another, or he is more of a patriot than a politician, meaning that he is a better patriot than a politician. This is possible from the related notion that one can be “a bit of a politician” and “a bit of a patriot” at the same time. The comparison is that of the man in his two capacities. The latter construction, therefore, does not admit of a direct translation, but has to be paraphrased. Similarly—

That sounds like more of a gamble (than a proper trade).  
It’s more of a propagandist novel, written to preach socialism (than an art novel).

The construction more often than not is also rather peculiar:—

(It happen) More often than not, our salaries were deducted on account of all sorts of special emergency taxes.  
More often than not, he had to be helped out of his financial difficulties at the end of the year.

### 10.16. Weakened Superlatives

In all languages, superlatives have been abused. All merchants claim their goods to be “the best.” From the movie advertisements, one gets the idea that every film is “the best picture of the year” or “the most gorgeous spectacle” or “the most stupendous production” or “played by the greatest galaxy of stars” since human history began. The abuse of the superlative is only an exaggerated form of the common habit to use it in a loose, and consequently weakened, meaning. Thus in the modern Pekingnese dialect, t’ing (挺) has been developed as a weakened superlative for the more logical ting (頂). T’ing hao means very much the same as English “very good” (conveying very little enthusiasm on the part of the speaker), while ting hao means “the best.” In English, the word “dearest” has probably been very often abused. But quite apart from such conventional forms, weakened superlatives are employed everyday of our life. Thus we say, “He is a most learned scholar,” “We spent a most agreeable evening,” “I read a most interesting novel,” or “He was the funniest man I ever saw.” In polite conversation, we also often say “With the greatest pleasure” in reply to some request, or “I shall be most delighted to see you,” when we mean only “very delighted.”

Very, although not a superlative, is similarly weakened, and its function is very often more euphonic than logical, (like Chinese 很 in 很好, 很高, 很壞). This has developed to such an extent that today, the words many, few, little, much, far, near are less commonly used alone than very many, very few, very little, very much, very far, very near. That this is purely euphonic is shown by the fact that when some other adv. is used, very can be very well dropped.

There are very few, so few, not few people there. (Better than “There are few people there.”)  
It is very far, not far, or so far. But never “It is far,” and seldom “It is far from here.”)  
I like you very much. (Never “I like you much.”)  
He eats very little. (Seldom “He eats little.”)  
Very good. (More common than “Good!”)

(Notice we say 這個人很壞, or 壞透了, but never 壞 alone.)

### 10.20. Comparison with a Standard

Instead of comparing several things with one another, we might compare a thing with some standard, expressed or implied. Here superiority is indicated by words like too, above, and the prefixes over-, hyper-. Equality is indicated by the phrase as . . . as or so . . . as, and by the adv. enough. Inferiority is indicated by not enough and the prefix under-. Both too and enough go with to (introducing the standard of comparison) or with for (usually introducing a person as the standard).

(1) Too . . . to, too . . . for and allied terms. Notice carefully the constructions involved in the following examples and note the word or phrase serving as the “standard” for comparison.

This exercise may be too easy for you, but it is too difficult for me.  
Death is too good for him (=He should be punished by something worse than death).  
Tennis is too strenuous for a man of my age.  
It is too beautiful to be true (=It can’t be true).  
I am too busy to attend to this (too busy for that).  
Nothing is too good for his new house. (He wants absolutely the very best material to be used.)  
For Confucius’ taste, rice could never be too white, and mincemeat could never be chopped too fine (食不厭精, 脍不厭細: could never be white enough = the whiter, the better).  
Your gown is too bright-coloured for this occasion.  
I am too tired to work tonight.  
This food is too hot to eat, too hot to be eaten, too hot for me, too hot for eating, too hot for me to eat, too hot for comfort.

There are also phrases like above normal, above my ability, beyond my power, beyond his means (= too expensive for him), beyond me (=beyond my ability or my understanding), beyond (any) doubt, beyond (any) question. Notice also the prefixes which express the same notion as too: overeat (=eat too much, eat more than is good for one’s health), oversleep (=sleep overtime), overwork, overdo (=go too far in something proper or commendable in itself, as, “Don’t overdo it”), overreach oneself (=reach out so far that one falls—often figuratively); supernatural, supernatural superhuman, superdreadnought (= warship of the class above Dreadnought), superfine (in commercial language, =of extra quality); hypersensitive (=over-sensitive), hypercritical (=too critical), hypertension (of nerves or blood pressure).

More than. Besides the usual use in more than two, etc., there are other forms that require more attention. Study the following constructions carefully:—

(Subject Omitted)  
He eats more than is good for him. (More than what is good for him. Regarding this ellipsis, see §9.82.)  
You have talked more than is necessary.  
I have done more than is required by the law.

(Object Omitted)  
He eats more than he can digest. (More than what he can digest. The object what is omitted.)  
That is more than (what) I can say. (It is beyond my knowledge.)  
He got more than (what) he asked for.  
That was more than (what) he expected.

(Followed by an infinitive):  
He knows better than to go out alone on such a night.  
I am wiser than to believe that.

(Followed by an adj.):  
This is more than fine: it is excellent.  
She was more than pretty: she was beautiful.  
He was more than clever: he was a great artist.  
We have more than enough.

(2) Enough to, enough for, as . . . as and allied expressions:—

There are enough bacilli in this test-tube to kill the whole city population.  
This room is hot enough to bake potatoes in.  
In one year, he spent (or she saved) enough to buy three villas.  
This food is just enough for eight people.  
We have enough eggs (or eggs enough) to last us three days (or enough for three days).  
There is noise enough to wake up the dead.  
I had enough to do to catch the tram (could barely catch it).  
Enough work for today.

The construction as . . . as is entirely unlike anything in Chinese.

as soon as possible  
as often as you like  
as soon as you are ready  
as high as your shoulder  
as heavy as can be borne (cf. “more than is good” above)  
as hot as a furnace  
as hot as ninety-two degrees  
as hot as last summer  
as rich as Baron Rothschild  
as drunk as a lord  
as dead as a doornail  
as tall as he (or as he is)  
as interesting as a novel  
as beautiful as a rose  
as quick as lightning, etc.

The use of so . . . as (followed by a word or phrase) and so . . . that (followed by a clause) is quite common. They both express a degree of quality defined by the following phrase or clause, quite similar in function to the word teh (得) in 熱得疼手, 熱得頭昏, etc.

Exercise 88. (A) Translate the following into Chinese:—  
1. so hot as to burn your fingers  
2. so hot that one can scarcely breathe  
3. so soon as I can come  
4. so bright as to dazzle your eyes  
5. so big that two can sit in it  
6. so excited that he forgot his appointment  
7. so fat that she could not climb the stairs  
8. so quiet that you could hear a pin fall  
9. so happy about it that she cried

(B) Translate the following into English, using so . . . that, or so . . . as, to describe a degree:—  
1. 我疲得不能走路。                    5. 這機器熱得燙手。  
2. 我熱得不能喘氣。                    6. 他急得要哭出來。  
3. 那天熱得瓶中金魚都死了。            7. 他窮得沒錢買米。  
4. 日光亮得不能開眼。                  8. 他窮得不能付每月房租。

(3) Not enough, etc. Cases like not hot enough and not as hot as differ from the examples given under “2” only in having not added. The prefix under- is sometimes used to express the idea of insufficiency.

food is underdone (not cooked enough)  
workman is underpaid (not paid enough)  
photograph is under-exposed (not exposed long enough)  
writer has been underrated or underestimated (not rated or regarded as high as he deserves)  
article is undersized (size is smaller than the normal or than what is required)  
man is underweight (weighs less than the normal for his height and sex)

### 10.30. Degree of Difference

The means of expressing the degree of difference between two objects is also worth studying. The prep. by is most commonly used in this connexion, as may be seen from the following examples:—

Tom is older than Jim by three years.  
Jim is taller than Effie by an inch and half.  
Busy Bee won (the horse race) by a neck.  
This is by far the best way of meeting the difficulty.  
We won by 2-0.  
I missed the train by three minutes.  
Gold has risen by three points.

(In the last three examples, comparison is implied.)

Nn. indicating measures are often used for this purpose without any introductory prepp.

Jim is an inch and half taller than Effie.  
Tom is one pound heavier than Steward.  
She is a year older than her younger brother.  
They are miles apart.  
Prof. McMurray is head and shoulders above the rest of the faculty in his scholarship.

Easily the best is also a common expression meaning “by far the best.”

### 10.31. Indeterminate Degrees

Most advv. of degree belong to this class. They fall roughly into the following divisions:—

(1) More or less, to a certain extent, rather, somewhat, fairly, etc.—

We did it more or less for fun.  
He is more or less crazy.  
I was more or less disappointed. Or: somewhat disappointed; to a certain extent disappointed; rather disappointed.  
To a certain extent he was wrong. In a way he was wrong.  
To a certain extent (to a certain degree), this is excusable. This is more or less excusable, or in a way excusable.  
He understands English fairly well.  
We had fairly enough (i.e., enough for practical purposes, though not quite enough).

(Fairly often used by Englishmen as a moderate way of saying "quite.")  
I was fairly puzzled.  
The opponent was fairly silenced.  
The company fairly went to pieces.  
I was fairly sick of the whole affair.

(Rather="somewhat," "slightly," "in a way.")  
I rather think you know him.  
He came rather late.  
I feel rather tired.  
The performance was rather a failure.  
It was rather good.  
The singing fell rather flat.

(2) A little, hardly, scarcely, barely, etc.—

I was a little tired, unwilling, angered, frightened.  
He was slightly hurt.  
The little child was not a bit afraid. The big man was not a bit ashamed. He was a bit proud of his daughter.  
I don't care a bit (a rap, a twopence) what you say.

Little is different from a little, being negative in meaning = "not much.")  
He is little known round here.  
The people live in houses little better than hovels.  
You little know how much I suffered during your absence.  
We had little more than three pounds a week to live on.  
I am little interested in your proposition.

(Hardly and scarcely are also negative in meaning="almost not.")

Hardly (=almost not) a man turned up.  
We had hardly (=almost no) time to finish the lesson.  
I could hardly believe what he said.  
That is hardly possible.  
There was hardly a soul there.  
I had hardly a penny left.  
I hardly ever (=almost never) see him.  
That is hardly better than what he gave him.  
He is hardly known outside his native town.

(Scarcely could be used for all these sentences and in any place where hardly is used.)

(Barely="only just," is less negative in meaning than hardly.)

We had barely (=only just) enough.  
He was barely five feet tall.  
It is not barely (=only just) a question of money.  
That is barely possible.  
We had barely five minutes left.  
We had plenty of coal, barely enough rice, but could get no vegetable.

(3) A lot, very, much, far, considerably, etc.—

This way of doing it is a lot (lots, far) better.  
We got a lot (lots) more room that way.  
I can tell you something far (a lot) more interesting.  
A is far (greatly) superior to B.  
I am feeling a lot better (or a great deal, a good deal, sometimes a deal better).  
He was to a great extent responsible for the failure.  
After ten o'clock, the patient felt considerably better.  
M— was far too clever for him.  
The sales have been considerably (noticeably) increased.

decidedly heavier             appreciably lighter  
considerably greater          greatly changed  
noticeably affected           tremendously successful  
remarkably clever             exceptionally beautiful  
markedly improved             incomparably the best

Difference between “very” and “much.” Very is usually used with adj. (very ill, very good, very interesting); while much is usually used with past participles (much pleased, much influenced, much improved, much destroyed, or very much pleased, etc.). Much is also used with the comparative degree (much better, much greater, much more difficult). But there is a class of past participles which are so much used that they have practically become adj. Thus we can say I feel very tired, but never I feel much tired (cf. a very tired look on his face). The difficulty is that usage varies extremely in this respect and the line of distinction between the past participles that can be used as adj. and those that cannot is very difficult to draw. Unless one is sure that very is correct, much should be used before past participles. Very (besides much) may be safely used with pleased, delighted, surprised, worried and frightened when these words are not followed by by. In the latter case, they are really used as past participles in that particular connexion. When in doubt, greatly may be substituted.

On the other hand, adj. which can be used only predicatively (after the nn.) and never attributively (before the nn.) generally go with much and not very. E.g., I am very much afraid (one cannot say a very afraid man) / He is very much like his father, very much behind the others / They are very much alike.

Exercise 89. Fill in the word very or much (or very much) in the following blanks:—

1. I shall be _______ pleased to see you.  
2. A _______ celebrated writer was present at the meeting.  
3. After years of absence, he found his wife _______ changed.  
4. The sale has been _______ increased through this new method.  
5. While in Paris, he was _______ influenced by one of his fellow-students.  
6. He was _______ worried about the affair.  
7. He was _______ surprised to find only three men in the room.  
8. The picture was _______ admired by many visitors.  
9. The professor cut the tail into two, and placed them _______ apart.  
10. After two weeks’ rest, his condition was _______ improved.  
11. I hear a _______ exaggerated story.  
12. The story has been _______ exaggerated by him.  
13. I feel _______ concerned about it.  
14. He was _______ disappointed by her absence.  
15. Lucy went home alone, _______ disappointed.

(4) Quite, almost, principally, largely, wholly, partly, etc. Largely means “for the greater part” (大半, 多半), while greatly means “very much.” Principally, chiefly, and largely mean about the same thing. Wholly, entirely, completely and perfectly are used with both desirable and undesirable qualities or conditions, while utterly and totally are usually restricted to undesirable qualities or conditions, and all these words are opposed to partly. Absolutely is opposed to relatively or comparatively. Some examples follow:—

it is perfectly clear  
is absolutely sure, sincere  
is relatively certain  
entirely successful or unsuccessful  
entirely his own  
perfectly useless, right  
perfectly happy, contented  
partly my mistake  
partly broken, conquered  
largely his fault  
largely through my help.  
wholly, completely successful  
principally caused by  
utterly wrong, useless  
utterly forgotten, mistaken  
totally ignorant  
totally unaware of, unprepared for  
chiefly for that purpose  
chiefly for gain  
chiefly mathematics and English  
quite broken-hearted  
quite absorbed  
quite meaningless, cold, common, proper  
almost blind  
almost penniless

Exercise 90. (A) Make sentences with the above examples or with similar constructions of your own.

(B) Make sentences with:—  
considerably markedly exceptionally  
greatly appreciably immensely  
remarkably noticeably reputedly  
decidedly tremendously knowingly

after the models given under “3” above.

(5) Not too, none too, not over, not altogether, etc., English dislike of being over-demonstrative and the English avoidance of superlatives as a matter of good form have resulted in the frequent use of negative or reversed expressions (cf. § 3.45). Thus “very unhappy” is often expressed by not too happy, and very unpleasant is often expressed by not (none) too pleasant. This form has now been often used to express undesirable qualities, and always savors of disapproval. Thus Not too clever is often used to express a warning against, or disapproval of, a stupid act. Further examples are:—

He was none too pleased about it.  
He went as ordered, but was none too quick about it.  
I am not over-hopeful about the situation.  
They didn't get along too well together.  
He wasn't over-happy about the whole affair.  
I didn't have too much money to spend for such idle purposes.  
Don't be too sure about it.  
I wasn't over-enthusiastic about it from the very beginning.  
This was not altogether an easy task (a success).  
She was not altogether unwilling (was, in fact, quite willing).

### 10.32. Limitation

We have already learnt the use of as . . . as in §10.20 “2.” A slightly different sense of limitation with reference to the degree of quality is suggested by such expressions as the following:—“I am willing to go so far and no farther,” or “He will stay as long (or so long) as his finances will permit.” The idea is that up to a certain point the degree of quality or action is admitted. The most typical example is the English phrase as far as . . . is concerned.

As far as I am concerned, you can go anywhere you please.  
As far as the accused are concerned, it is up to the court to settle the question.  
As far as the creditor is concerned, the debt must be paid. (He does not care how the money is obtained to pay it.)  
As far as the question of international debts concerns the United States, the problem is whether to have all the gold flow to America or to have her trade revived.

Note also the following phrases:—

As far as I know, nobody was in the room this morning.  
I will take up the matter as far as I am able to. (To the best of my ability.)  
He took down as much of the conversation as he was able to understand (and left unrecorded what he could not understand.)  
Stretch your arms as far as possible.  
Eat as much as you can.  
She was as good a mother as could be.

So long as and inasmuch as are other phrases indicating this kind of limitation. Like the adv. of degree the in *The sooner, the better* (see below §10.33), these phrases also bring in the idea of a causal relationship.

So long as you persist in your old ways, I cannot give you any money.  
So long as there is no political stability in China, industry cannot be developed.  
So long as the people's ideas are not changed, a change in the form of government will mean nothing.  
So long as things remain what they are, communism and banditry are bound to grow in China.  
Inasmuch as you know the story already, I will not tell it again. You shall be forgiven this time, inasmuch as you realize you error.  
Mr. Chen ought to be consulted, inasmuch as he is paying the money.  
In so far as this matter concerns all of us, we should take a united action.  
In so far as you were responsible for the starting of this scheme, you ought to pay more for it than the others.

### 10.33. Cumulative Degrees

Another type of ideas is expressed by such expressions as He is getting better and better, where not any one definite degree but rather a progressive series are indicated. This is sometimes suggested by the word gradually (逐渐) alone, as Judaism gradually went out of existence in China, but sometimes by such phrases as smaller and smaller, weaker and weaker, poorer and poorer. Some examples follow:—

While he was growing richer and richer, his country was becoming poorer and poorer.  
The attacks (of epilepsy, melancholia, etc.) became more and more frequent.  
The patient steadily grew worse.  
He was daily becoming weaker and weaker, and was compelled to take bigger and bigger doses of sleeping powder.  
He found it more and more difficult (or increasingly difficult) to resist the temptation.  
As his health and his will-power grew weaker and weaker, he indulged himself more and more.

Of particular interest is the use of the in this connexion as an adv. of degree, meaning “by so much” or “by that much.” The more he flatters me, the more I dislike him means “By so much more he flatters me, by that much more I dislike him.”

The older we grow, the more shameless we become.  
The sooner you can come, the better (it is for me). The sooner, the better.  
The more she keeps him away, the more he admires her.  
The more people there are, the merrier it is. The more, the merrier.

From the meaning “by that much,” the thus develops another meaning “on that account,” as is suggested by the second the in each of the above examples. Hence, we get expressions like all the better (=so much better on that account), all the worse (=so much worse on that account), or so much the worse.

And if I am mistaken and he is right, then so much the worse for China.  
He has left the town? So much the worse for him (=so much worse on that account, as an added evidence of his guilt.)  
A long delayed home letter is all the more welcome (=on account of the long delay.)  
He has tried to buy me all sorts of presents, but I do not like him the more for it.  
He was none the better for having a diploma, and I none the worse for not having it.  
We shall invite him, and if he won't come, all the better.

Exercise 91. Construct some sentences, using the phrases none the worse, all the better, so much the worse, etc. after the above models. Also complete the following sentences:—

The longer you wait, . . . . The older he grows, . . . .  
The less he hears about this, . . . . The more I think of it, . . . .  
The more you urge him to go, . . . . The richer he becomes, . . . .  
The poorer he becomes, . . . . The more people oppose him, . . . .

### 10.40. Choice and Comparison: “Had Better” and “Would Rather”

There is a difference between choice (between two different things or qualities) and comparison (between different degrees of the same quality). When I say, “I like apples rather than pears,” it means I like apples, and really do not like pears; but when I say, “I like apples more than pears,” the meaning is that I like both, but am fonder of one than of the other. Thus we may also state a choice or consideration of two opposite qualities. When we say, “This is deep brown rather than yellow,” the question is whether the thing is yellow at all, not whether it is more yellow or less yellow than another.

Would rather. The word rather is most frequently used for stating two different qualities or courses of action. In referring to actions, would rather is the regular form used, while had rather is also allowable. In most cases, an infinitive without to is used after than. Observe the tense and construction of the following examples carefully:—

I would rather die than surrender.  
He resigned rather than stifle his conscience.  
Dying rather than surrender (=dying-rather-than-surrender) was the decision of every one of the garrison.  
Rather than undertake to keep three Russians at Shanghai under surveillance, the Municipal Council deported them.  
He would rather have died than refused (infinitive with have omitted; not past tense).  
I would much rather not go.  
Use soft water rather than hard.  
He showed the desire to seem clever rather than honest.  
I had rather err with Plato than be right with Horace.  
I had (or would) rather not say anything about it.  
I would rather leave the posts vacant than fill them with inferior men (寧缺毋濫).

Had better, followed by an infinitive without to is a common form used in offering advice. It indicates a course of action in preference to some other course. Prefer is also often used for indicating choice between two things or courses of action (prefer something more desirable to, and not than, something less desirable). Some examples follow:—

Don’t you think you had better go home now?  
You’d better run along.  
You’d better find out what he is doing.  
He preferred the English to the French.  
She prefers working to begging.  
He prefers water to wine.  
X prefers Egyptian cigarettes.  
Y prefers to stay (would rather stay than go.)  
Z prefers to be left alone.  
I prefer to say nothing about it.  
Noulens preferred to die of starvation rather than submit to this treatment.

### 10.50. Comparison and Case

A comparison always requires at least two things to be compared. It is important that we make clear to ourselves what are the things thus compared. When we say, “She loves him more than the child,” the comparison may be between the lady and the child (more than the child loves him) or between the husband and the child (more than she loves the child). Fortunately, when a pron. is used, the meaning is made clear through the case of the pron.—She loves the child more than he (loves the child), or She loves the child more than (she loves) him. See the meaning implied in the following:—

You could do it better than I.  
I could talk French as well as he.  
There is no better man than he to take up this job.  
They were admiring the Queen rather than Confucius.  
The remark was intended for him rather than me.

Notice also the persons or things that are compared in the following:—

Matthews wrote a longer essay than mine.  
Her dress is a prettier pink than my wife’s  
Your house is better situated and has bigger windows than mine.  
These stories are quite as interesting as those written by Andersen.  
The climate of Shanghai is not so damp as that of Hongkong.  
The grammar of the Chinese language is quite different from that of Japanese.  
His was a newer hat than Mr. Johnson's  
The arms of the chimpanzee are longer than those of man.

Exercise 52. Correct the following sentences, or decide which of the words in italics shall be used, as properly indicating the person or object compared:—

1. I smoke more cigars than him (he?). (Can one smoke him?)  
2. The leaves of the orange-tree are smaller than bananas.  
3. The goods at Wing On are cheaper than Sincere.  
4. The Chinese can roast ducks better even than France. (Can France be roasted?)  
5. Mrs. Davis is a taller woman than Mr. Davis. (Compare the height of the two persons.)  
6. My child is older than you (yours?).  
7. The cat has sharper claws than you. (Compare the cat's claws with your finger-nails.)  
8. Her rooms are better furnished than I (me? mine?).  
9. The distance between Shanghai and Nanking is greater than Hangchow.  
10. The skin of Chinese women is, as a whole, finer and smoother than foreign women  
11. The charges for printing English books are higher than Chinese books.  
12. The period of infancy of human beings is longer than the donkey.
