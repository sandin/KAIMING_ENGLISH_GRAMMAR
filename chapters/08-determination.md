## CHAPTER VIII: DETERMINATION

### 8.10. Representation, Determination and Modification

When we say this book, that book, my book, the book that you took away, we are using various ways to indicate or "determine" the particular book we mean, and this we call the problem of determination in grammar. Grammatical means of determination always answer the question "Which one?" Further examples are:—

- the same book
- either this or that book
- the other book
- each book
- some other book
- the respective books
- every other book
- any old book
- the second book
- whatever book

It will be seen that there is a close relation between determination and representation. The pronn. he, you, they, myself, themselves are all representative words, and yet they all help to "determine" which person we mean. "His book" also helps to answer the question, "Which book?"

There is also a close relation between determination and modification. We say, for instance, that in the red book, the adj. red modifies the n. book. It describes what kind of a book it is. But the word red serves also to limit the meaning of book by excluding the green ones, the blue ones, etc. It, therefore, also helps to "determine" the book meant. Generally, the modified nn. have a narrower or more restricted meaning than unmodified nn. "Northern Chinese" are only one part of the Chinese people, and "humorous essays" exclude essays that are not humorous. Moreover, determination is only one form of modification: this, a determinative word in this book, modifies the word book. It is only because the determinative words and phrases are both common and important that we study them as a class by themselves.

Thus we may distinguish three functions:—
- (1) Representation: to take the place of other words (Chap. VII).
- (2) Determination: to answer the question "Which one?" (Chap. VIII).
- (3) Modification: to modify or describe the meaning of other words (Chap. IX).

They are three classes of notions that we have to study, but one and the same word may serve two or three different functions at the same time.

### 8.11. Classes of Pronouns

In the old grammars, pronn. are classified in the following way:—
- (1) Personal: I, you, it (also possessive forms my, mine, your, yours), etc.
- (2) Demonstrative: this, that, which (pointing out which one).
- (3) Relative: "the man who escaped," "the girl that he loves," etc. (relating to a preceding word).
- (4) Interrogative: who? which? what? (used for asking questions).

It will be seen that the possessive pronn. my, your and the demonstrative pronn. this, that chiefly serve the purpose of determination. The relative pronn. serve as often to determine which one as for other purposes of modification, thus:—
- I know the man who escaped from prison. (Determining which person.)
- I know this man, who is a dirty rascal. (Describing the person.)

For convenience’ sake, the relative clauses will be studied in the next chapter on Modification.

The above division is useful and convenient as a classification of pronn. Regarded from the point of view of notions, however, these pronn. should be studied together with other classes of words serving the same purpose. Thus, both demonstrative adjj. and demonstrative pronn. serve the purpose of determination, and their distinction is really unimportant:—

**ADJECTIVES**                          **PRONOUNS**
This book.                           I know this.
Take another one.                    Take another.
Both men came.                       Both came.

The relative pronn. and the relative advv. should also be studied together as serving the same purpose of determination or modification:—

**RELATIVE PRON.**                       **RELATIVE ADV.**
Find out the man who said this.      Find out the time when he arrived.

### 8.20. Distinction: “This,” “That,” “Same,” “Other”

Like this and that, the words same and other may be used as adjj. (the same people, other people) or as pronn. (is the same, for others). The expressions the same as and the same that are generally used as in the following examples:—
- This is the same one that you saw yesterday.
- This is the same one as that (one).
- I eat the same food that you eat.
- My food is the same as yours.
- You are the same age as my sister.
- Wealth or poverty is all the same (or just the same) to me. (As adj.)
- But I thank you all the same (or just the same). (As adv.)

It is always best to use that when a clause follows (i.e., with a vb. expressed), and use as when a simple n. or pron. follows (i.e., when there is no vb. following, or when the vb. is understood).

When there is a vb. with the idea of sharing, we may use with, as—
- I live in the same room with him. (= I share a room with him.)

The use of another, the other and others follows the usage regarding the use or omission of a and the.
- A boy.                 Another boy.           (Indefinite sing.)
- Boys.                  Others.                (Indefinite pl.)
- The boy(s).            The other(s).          (Definite sing. or pl.)

Another is simply a compound word formed by an and other. We may say, also, some other boy or boys, any other boy(s) and no other boy(s), as we say some boy(s), any boy(s) and no boy(s). No other is followed by than, but different, differ are followed by from, e.g.—
- This is no other than the one we saw yesterday.
- It can be no other person than Mr. Ma himself.
- This is different from the one we saw.

**Exercise 57.** Study the following and find out why the words another, the other, others, the others and the words as, that, with, than are used. Then make some sentences with the same as, the same that, another, some other, any other, others, no other than, etc.
1. Is your book lost? Buy another.
2. There were two brothers. One was a cripple, and the other was deaf and dumb.
3. I am not speaking of Miss Yang; I am speaking of the other girl, her room-mate.
4. Only I was present. All the others were sick at home.
5. Another day, he came in at breakfast time.
6. Other people have other things to do.
7. He saw one (cinema) show after another.
8. Others may do what they like and say what they like, but I will not be influenced by them.
9. We must find some other way.
10. Is there any other person you want to see?
11. This is not the same book as mine.
12. It is the same that I borrowed from you.
13. He is the same person that called yesterday.
14. He can give no other reason than mere laziness for not handing in his composition.
15. If you insist on sending the letter, it will have to be signed by some other person than myself.

### 8.30. Possessive Pronouns and Nouns

We have studied in §§7.20-7.21 the possessive pronn. my, your, and mine, yours, etc. Nouns in the possessive case add an "apostrophe s" ('s) in the singular, as bird’s, person’s. These are all true determinative words, and are easy to use. The only peculiar forms of the possessives in ’s are exemplified by the following:

(a) Plural nouns:                           (b) Singulars in s:
- birds’ nest(s)                             - James’s horse
- three days’ journey                        - Jones’s children
- persons’ faults                            - Charles’s letter
- others’ ideas                              - Pythagoras’s teaching
- friends’ help                              - Ulysses’ Return
- parents’ consent                           - Moses’ journey
- women’s troubles                           - Jesus’ words

(c) For ~’s sake:
- for goodness’ sake
- for peace’ sake
- for convenience’ sake
- for conscience’ sake
(But, for brevity’s sake, for argument’s sake)

(d) Compound nouns:
- the Duke of York’s brother
- the Queen of Sheba’s beauty
- Schwab & Son’s
- Governor of New York’s statement
- Emperor of Japan’s cousin
- Government of India’s position

(e) Nouns in apposition:
- Philip the Great’s son
- Henry the Tailor’s bills.
- My brother Yujen’s book
- William the Second’s death

In (b) we read [siz] for s’s. Where the word already ends in s-s sounds (Ulysses, Moses, Jesus), it is best to omit the additional s just as in things’, birds’ (not things’s, birds’s). The examples in (c), for … sake, may be considered special cases; the apostrophe s is omitted because s’s before sake would not sound nice. The examples in (d) are compound names, and those in (e) contain two nn. which refer to the same person ("in apposition"). Of course we do not say my brother’s Yujen’s wife.

The expressions of yours, of mine, of my father’s have already been mentioned in § 7.21. They are quite peculiar and idiomatic English constructions. Examples of their use are:—
- He was a very dear friend of her uncle’s.
- It was a great idea of his that China could be saved through rural education.
- It was a fond hobby of my father’s to collect curios.
- It is a fond dream of mine to visit Spain.
- Those fingernails of yours are a disgrace.
- Look at that nice son of yours.
- Take home these paintings of his and tell me what you think of them.

Notice that in all these examples, either something familiar or something we are fond of is expressed. That nice son of yours (familiar use) implies also some contempt: compare Chinese 你那個好兒子. There is always some tinge of emotion (hatred, love, familiarity) associated with this form of possessives. There is no point in saying, for instance, the monthly income of his for his monthly income. In fact, we may call this the "familiar possessive."

Notice also we cannot say that your, this my for 你那個, 我這個 in English; we have to say that … of yours, this … of mine.

### 8.40. Apposition and Example

Following are examples of the use of apposition for the purpose of determination:—
- Your brother was killed. Which brother? Teh-ming. Your brother Teh-ming was killed.
- Teh-ming was killed. Which Teh-ming? Teh-ming, your brother, was killed.
- Mary, the mother of Jesus, was not Mary Magdalen.
- Edith Wharton, the woman novelist, is an American.
- Mr. Jones, the President of the National Bank, committed suicide last night.
- Captain Byrd, the explorer of the Antarctic, returned to civilization after a two years’ absence.
- My servant Ko-fu is now ill.
- There are many kinds of infectious diseases, cholera, typhoid and diphtheria, now in this city.
- I have met many famous men of their country, writers, generals, militarists and Socialist leaders.

In all these examples, the phrase in italics modifies or makes clear the meaning of the preceding n. or pron. The construction is therefore very simple. Words used in apposition must be in the same case as the words they modify, thus—
- Then we three, Kuo-fang, Min-cheng and I, started together.
- They tried to catch us, Kuo-fang, Min-cheng and me (myself).

In the last two examples in the first part of this section (There are many kinds of diseases, etc.), the words in apposition are really examples or instances (cholera, typhoid, diphtheria) of the word they modify (diseases). Such examples are usually introduced by the phrases:—
- such as
- as follows
- for example ("e.g.")
- that is ("i.e.")
- for instance
- namely ("viz.")

As follows is always used to mean as what follows. We never say as follow, even when many things follow.

**Exercise 58.** (I) Words in apposition are used for general purposes of modification as well as for determination. Point out the appositive words in the following and tell whether they are used only for determination or for other purposes of modification.
1. The Chinese Emperor, a mere boy of seven years old, had to abdicate the throne.
2. He, a father of grown-up daughters, was still running round with all sorts of women.
3. Edison, the famous inventor, is a friend of Henry Ford, the automobile king.
4. Herbert Hoover, the President of the United States, was an official mining engineer of the Manchu Government in his early days.
5. Your cousin Mary is engaged to be married.
6. Tom, the piper’s son, stole a pig.

(II) Fill in appositive words in the following:—
1. Mr. Chang, the —— of the paper, was arrested.
2. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the —— of the Kuomintang, is known to every Chinese boy and girl.
3. I like all kinds of fruit, ——, ——, —— and ——.

### 8.50. Sequence: the Ordinals

The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. are called "cardinals," while the numbers of sequence 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. are called "ordinals" in grammar. From the fourth on, the following numbers always take a th, except numbers with "one," "two," "three" which still keep the first, second and third. Eighth has only one t, ninth is spelt with the e in nine omitted, and twelveth becomes twelfth. Thus—
- fifth
- twelfth
- fiftieth
- eighth
- thirteenth
- forty-first
- ninth
- hundredth
- eighty-second
- tenth
- thousandth
- seventy-third
- eleventh
- fortieth
- hundred and first

Notice also that we say—
- Number one, but: the first one.
- Number two, but: the second one.
- Book one, but: the first book.
- Volume two, but: the second volume.

It is more common to use "No." with the bigger numbers, thus "prisoner No. 1075," "seat No. C 75," etc.

These ordinals form advv. by having -ly added to them, thus firstly, secondly, thirdly, lastly, etc. But first and last can otherwise be used as advv. also, as He came first, I came last, Last came the cripple.

Some special uses of these sequence words are shown in the following examples:—
- He came on the 12th (of this month).
- Go from the ground floor [楼下] to the first floor [二楼], then to the second floor [三楼], third floor [四楼], etc.
- The student gets promoted from the first form (or first year) [一年级] to the second form (or second year) [二年级], etc. In some places, first is the highest, and sixth is the lowest, but this is not usual.
- Take the next to the last seat. [倒数第二位]
- Pronounce the last word but (=except) one.
- Read from the last line but two. [倒数第三行]
- Next to Ke-min, Wang Lo is the best student in class. Wang Lo is the next best (or second best).
- Hand in your compositions next Wednesday (=nearest coming Wednesday=Wednesday of this week if said on Monday, Tuesday; but Wednesday of the next week if said on Thursday, etc.).
- I met him last Tuesday (or on Tuesday last).

**Exercise 59.** Make some sentences with some of the above phrases.

### 8.60. Alternation and Distribution

There are times when we want to refer to some particular numbers in a group or series, with a half definite and half indefinite meaning. The use of such expressions is best illustrated by examples.

Either...or, neither...nor, every other, every third, every ninth, etc.
- Either he or she is to blame.
- Either of the two (=any one) will do.
- You either do what I say or leave this place.
- What you do is neither wise nor honourable.
- Either come in or go out.
- He is neither able, nor experienced, nor willing to work hard and learn.
- They have now divorced each other, either through his or through her fault.
- I am not going to retract my words. Nor am I going to apologize. Neither is he.
- You have lost your job? I have nothing to do myself, either. I cannot help you, either. (=Nor can I help you.)
- Take either end (either this or that).
- The river overflowed on either side (=on both sides).
- If you do not go, I shall not either (=also).
- There is no time to lose, either (=besides).
- He came here every other day (=once in every two days=on alternate days).
- The doctor visits her every third day (or every three days).
- Every eighty-second year, the comet comes back to us.

Each, respective(ly). These may be called distributive words, for the meaning refers to each one or each group separately.
- They had one box each.
- Each of them was given a box.
- They had each a bed to himself.
- They had each his own bed.
- We went each our own way.
- We had each a new suit of uniform (or: new pair of shoes).
- Go to your respective seats. (=Go each to your own seat.)
- They were rewarded according to their respective merits (=each according to his merit).
- A and B contributed the respective sums of thirty and fifty dollars.
- The colleges for men and women are to be built respectively on the south and southeast sides of the compound.

(For the use of each other and one another, see §7.23.)

**Exercise 60.** Use the above phrases in sentences of your own.

### 8.70. “A,” “An” and “The”

A boy means an indefinite boy, and the boy means a definite boy. This is really the same as Chinese i-ko (一個) and cheh-ko (這個). Hence, a is called "the indefinite article" and the is called the "definite article." A expresses indefinite singular (a boy), while indefinite plural is expressed without any article (boys). Thus we have—

|          | Singular | Plural   |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Indefinite | a boy    | boys     |
| Definite   | the boy  | the boys |

All this is very simple and just like the Chinese i-ko jen, cheh-ko jen, jen (一個人, 這個人, 人). The only difference is Chinese nn. have no plural ending, so that the indefinite plural is expressed in Chinese, for example, by jen ta hu, hu ch'ih jen (人打虎, 虎喫人, like singular in form), but in English by Men kill tigers and Tigers eat men (in plural form).

But in English, abstract nn. (knowledge, courage) and mass-words (water, milk) have no plural forms, because they really have no number and cannot be counted (it would be nonsense to say one knowledge, two knowledges), so it happens that indefinite abstract nn., like Chinese words, are expressed in the singular form without any article. Thus—

**ABSTRACT**
- Knowledge is virtue.
- Knowledge kills virtue.
- Virtue kills knowledge.

**CONCRETE**
- Women are men.
- Women marry men.
- Men marry women.

Compare Chinese 女子無才便是德 ("Having no knowledge is a virtue for women"), with no article before 才, 德.

On the other hand, definite abstract nn. or mass-words may have the article the, as the water you drink, the knowledge of the students, the milk in the coffee, the health of the family.

“An” is used instead of “a” before words beginning with the vowels, a, e, i, o, u, except when these vowels are pronounced really with a consonant, w or y, at the beginning. Thus the “long u” is really [j+u:] and so requires a instead of an. Examples are:—
- a university [,jn(ɪ)niˈvɜːs(i)ti]
- such a one [wʌn]
- a useful servant
- a one-hour class
- a once popular writer

Some people still write an historian, because h in the unaccented syllable his- is weakened so that the word is pronounced almost like an istorian. Also: an historical play, an heroic act [(h)isˈtɔrikəl; (h)iˈrouik]. But today many people do not do this; they use a even before h in unaccented syllables.

**Exercise 61.** Point out in the following why a or the is used, or why both are omitted. Is the meaning definite or indefinite, singular or plural, or neither singular nor plural (with abstract words which cannot be counted)?
1. A letter was received from Hongkong, but, as it was unsigned, nobody knows who was the writer of the letter.
2. There was a Jones in the same college.
3. A man named Bailey called this morning, but finding you not at home, he walked all over the house.
4. Jackson is one of the best students in physics, if not the best.
5. A Mrs. Watson was at the witness box.
6. That’s a lie!
7. Liars must have a good memory.
8. Beggars must not be choosers.
9. They are talking like a pair of lovers.
10. That’s the girl!
11. It’s the only right thing to do.
12. Have the letter sent at once.
13. Help me with money, and not with empty words.
14. You can have everything you want now, money, freedom, a beautiful wife, a nice house and garden, dinners and parties, and vacation trips.
15. Be careful of wine and women.
16. He is giving up medicine and going to study law.
17. Don’t talk to me about religion and sins and prayers.
18. I want three things in life: work, a good library, and a woman who understands.

### 8.71. Generalization: “a Cat,” “the Cat,” “Cats”

When we talk about things in general, we may use the plural without article or use a or the in the "generic singular" (§ 5.25). Thus—
- (1) Englishmen are usually reserved in manners.
- (2) An Englishman seldom talks to strangers.
- (3) The Englishman is quite different from the Frenchman in his manners.

The third form refers to an abstract idea of "the Englishman," and is not found in Chinese. Here the abstract "Englishman" is made to represent "all Englishmen." Also—
- (1) Cats are afraid of dogs.          (Indefinite pl.)
- (2) A cat is afraid of a dog.         (Indefinite sing.)
- (3) The cat is afraid of the dog.     (Abstract type)

I love a good liar really means the same thing as I love good liars.

**Exercise 62.** Study the following examples, and see if it is possible sometimes to change the generic singulars into generic (or indefinite) plurals and vice versa:—
1. According to the Christian prayer-book, the bridegroom promises to love and protect, and the bride promises to love and obey.
2. The short story is a modern invention, and so are short skirts.
3. The steam-engine was invented over a hundred years ago.
4. The boy stays with his father four months in the year, and lives with his mother during the rest of the time.
5. The modern mother does not feed her baby at midnight. The baby will sleep till early morning once it forms the habit.
6. Modern fathers must be good pals (=comrades) to their sons.
7. Mr. Hsii has all the poet’s ways and the poet’s weaknesses.
8. When a lion meets a lamb, one plus one makes one.
9. Mr. Ma looks like a thinker. He has the thinker’s face, thin and wan.
10. The busy doctor’s time is not his own.
11. Do actors and actresses always lead immoral lives? Must they always have scandals?
12. What can a poor man do?
13. This costs $3.75 a yard.

### 8.72. Special Uses of “A” and “The”

There are some special uses of “a” and “the” which must be mentioned here.

(1) In regard to pronunciation, a is pronounced [ei] when accented or stressed, but otherwise and generally [ə]. The is pronounced [ði:] only when accented or stressed, otherwise [ðə] before following consonants, and [ði] before vowels. As Chinese students of English often make a mistake in pronouncing these two words generally with accent or stress when they should be unaccented, it is very important for them to learn to pronounce them correctly.
- I said a hat, an egg, not hats, eggs. [ai sed 'ei 'hæt | 'æn  'eg| not 'hæts | 'egz —|]
- Yes, that is the Mr. Wang I mean. ['jes ðæts 'ði: mistə 'wɑŋ ai 'mi:n | — | ]
- a boy [ə 'bɔi]
- the story [ðə 'stɔ:ri]
- an eagle [æn  'i:gl]
- the horse [ðə 'hɔ:s]
- the idea [ði ai'diə]
- the ear [ði 'iə] or [ðiː 'iə]
- the only... [ði 'ounli...]
- the ants [ði 'ænts]

(2) What a, quite a, such a, many a, rather a.—
- What a lie!
- Quite a long essay.
- What a nuisance!
- Many a time.
- Such a question!
- Many a young man.
- Such a government.
- Many a husband.
- Such a fool.
- Rather a nuisance.
- Quite a comfort.
- Rather a failure.
- Quite a good student.
- Rather a new thing.

(3) How ... a, too ... a, so ... a, as ... a.—
- How different a fate!
- So rash a step.
- Too serious a matter.
- So good an opportunity.
- Too important a question.
- As quick a writer as...
- So queer an idea.
- As able a man as...

Instead of how different a fate, we can say what a different fate, and instead of so queer an idea, we can say such a queer idea.

(4) "The" before proper names. "The" is generally not used before proper names, except (a) before river names, (b) before proper names in plural, (c) when denoting some particular phase or aspect of the thing represented by the proper name, and (d) when followed by an adj.
- (a) The Yellow River. The Yangtse. The Nile. The Rhine.
- (b) The Lins and Chens. The Stuarts. The Chinese. The Alps.
- (c) The China (of) today is not the China of our grandfathers. The John Roebuck that I know is quite a different kind of person. She sees only the Rod at the fireside, the Rod who plays with his children, not the Rod who swings the whip over poor workers.
- (d) The young Dickens (Dickens when he was young). The noble and great Frederick. The seventy-year-old Mr. Chang had to call the five-year old Wu-chi "uncle." The old China. The new China.

(5) “The” as adv. of degree. This use is very common. Examples are:—
- The sooner he is gone, the better it is for all of us. The sooner gone, the better. The sooner, the better.
- The more, the better.
- The more, the merrier. The more people there are, the merrier it is.
- The more he flatters, the less I like him.
- The older he grows, the more shameless he becomes.
- If he will not come, that is so much the better.
- Instead of hating him, I like him all the more for it.
- He refused to pay? So much the worse for him.

**Exercise 63.** Make some sentences with the phrases studied in this section.

### 8.73. Omission of “A” and “The”

The use or omission of “a” or “the” is often a difficult thing to decide. Many foreign students who have studied English for ten or twenty years still often find a doubt in meeting with such a question. Thus, shall we say “find a doubt,” or “find doubt” or “find doubts” in the above sentence? There is a psychological reason for this difficulty, and we shall soon see it.

(1) It is clear that, as we have said in §8.70, abstract nn. and mass-words require no article (the or a), when the meaning is indefinite, but require the definite article the, when the meaning is definite. Thus:—

**INDEFINITE**                           **DEFINITE**
- He wants power                      But: He wants the power to vote.
- Drink water.                        But: Drink the water in the cup.

Hence, we also say have patience, take time, spend money, because patience, time, money are regarded as abstract nn., and eat ice-cream, drink tea, add milk because ice-cream, tea and milk are mass-words (§4.51).

So far so good. But examine the following common phrases, all with the omitted:—
- go to school (hospital)
- out of job
- in school (class)
- at sunrise
- after class
- at night (but: in the night)
- after dinner
- by day
- during dinner
- all day long
- have (take) dinner
- at noon (midday)
- go to church
- without (beyond) question
- after sermon
- without doubt
- go to bed
- sold at auction
- lie in bed
- shut up shop
- out of bed
- open shop (school)
- at table
- take bath
- go to law-court
- in fashion
- at home
- for (on) sale
- not in office
- on business

Notice that all the nn. in the above examples refer to some action or event. The peculiarity of an action or event is that it is half visible and half invisible. We can see some people eating at dinner; therefore, we say we can see the dinner. And yet we cannot touch the dinner (or dining) as we can touch a table. These words are therefore half concrete and half abstract words, standing between the abstract nn. hunger, satisfaction and the concrete nn. knives and forks. Hence, we sometimes use, and sometimes omit, the article. We say:—
- After crying..................Or: after a good cry.
- Give help.....................Or: give a help.
- Serve dinner.................Or: serve a dinner.
- Under examination........Or: under an examination.

Now, in the above examples (go to school, etc.) all the seemingly concrete words school, church, class, bed, hospital, home, office, law-court really stand for some sort of action (teaching, praying, studying, sleeping, etc.). Hence, we can say:
- Go to school.................Or: go to the school.
- Go to hospital..............Or: go to a hospital.
- Not in office...............Or: not in the office.
- Beyond question............Or: beyond a question.
- Take bath...................Or: take a bath.
- Have dinner................Or: have a dinner.
- Resign work...............Or: resign the work.
- Sold at auction.............Or: sold at an auction.
- Shut up shop................Or: shut up the shop.

And, because the above phrases are in very common use, therefore, we habitually omit the article before the nn. It is more idiomatic to say “Have dinner with me” than to say “Have a dinner with me.”

(2) A second source of trouble is that abstract nn, often have concrete meanings, and nn. of action (or, we may say, half-concrete nn.) often develop abstract meanings (cf. §§4.20-4.30). If we regard them as abstract, we often drop the article, and if we regard them as concrete, or partially concrete, we use a or the. Thus—

**CONCRETE**                                      **ABSTRACT**
- They have formed a trade union.             In union there is strength.
- This man has a special system for            What you want here is system.
 indexing.
- She has found a new love (=lover).           She does not understand what love is.
- He gave me a wrong medicine.                 He is going to study medicine.
- Where is the money you gave me?              He has money, influence and power.
- Take up a business.                          Business is as usual.
- Learn a trade.                                Trade is at a standstill.
- Receive a favour.                             Show favour to some one.

**Exercise 64.** Take some of the above phrases (go to school, in school, after class, etc.) and some of the nn. of action, and concrete or abstract nn., and use them in sentences of your own. Show the reason why the article is used or omitted. His, my, this, etc. may be used instead of the article.

(3) The article is often dropped in regular phrases, as the soldiers in uniform (not in a uniform, or in uniforms), and translate word by word (not one word by one word), learn it by heart (not by the heart). Often, it is possible to insert the article or the words some, any, my, etc., when the meaning is more concrete and specialized and the phrase loses therefore its general character. Thus, we say, at last or at the last, by chance or by a queer chance, beyond question or beyond any question, go by train or go by the next train. See if you can use the following phrases:—
- week by week
- go by boat
- day by day
- come by train
- step by step
- set foot on China 到中國
- man for man 以個人比較
- came on foot 步行而來
- tit for tat 報復
- leave word for him 留言
- in case, in this case
- in point of fact 事實上
- in fact, in actual fact
- in view of 為…起見
- by chance, by some chance
- clean house 掃除積弊
- at heart, at his heart
- play tennis
- by mistake, by a bad mistake
- at night
- eat by mouth
- at noon

(4) Finally, articles may be omitted before nn. used as modifiers, which approach adj. in meaning:—
- He was not man enough to confess his mistake.
- Mr. Hsü, poet and painter, arrived yesterday.
- I met Mr. Hsü, the brother of Hsü Tien-hsi and husband of Su-cheng (second the usually omitted).
- They have elected him president of the company.
- He acted as secretary to Li Yuan-hung.

### 8.80. Indetermination

We have studied now the various means of expressing determination, whether definite or indefinite (a and the), and of making generalizations (§ 8.71). It remains now to study how the idea of lack of determination is expressed in English. The common phrases are:—
- Marry any old fool for a husband.
- Pay it in any old way you want.
- Pay it in whatever way you want.
- I will do it, whatever he says.
- Whatever you do, don't offend him again.
- Whatever you think of it, I am going to get married to this girl.
- Is there any chance whatever of our escape?
- He has no friend whatever in this city.
- He cannot do it, however he tried.
- He cannot do it, no matter how he tried.
- He will not consent, no matter how hard you try to persuade him.
- No matter what you think, it is I who am going to get married.
- No matter what you do, don't offend him again.
- I will do it, no matter what he says
- You can pay me at any time, no matter when.
- In any case, there is no use discussing it now.
- Anyhow, it is too late now.
- The boat floated wherever it pleased.
- Wherever Mary went, the little lamb was sure to go.
- Wherever there is a stream of water with fish in it, there you may look for the kingfisher.
- You may come whenever you like (please).
- The kingfisher flies away whenever it sees a man.

The words whatever, whoever, however, whenever, wherever require some special notice. The last three are easy and are used as special forms of the conjunctive adv. how, when and where, introducing clauses. Thus—
- How he tried.
- When he remembers.
- Where he went.
- However he tried.
- Whenever he remembers.
- Wherever he went.

Whatever, whoever, too, can be used as special forms of what (=no matter what) and who (=no matter who). The only peculiar thing to notice here is that we often have apparently two vbb. to these words. Thus in—
- (What I have) is yours,
- (Whatever I have) is yours,

it is quite clear that what(ever) I have is the subject of is. Hence we have such constructions as—
- (What is left) is quite worthless.
- (Whatever is left) is taken away.

Similarly, who and whoever are used as in the following:—
- (Who steals my purse) steals trash.
- (Who breaks) pays.
- (Whoever said this) is a liar.
- (Whoever kills the enemy captain) shall have my daughter for his wife.

It would be wrong to say—
- Whoever said this, he is a liar.
- Whoever kills the enemy chief, he shall marry my daughter.

Compare also §7.31 “c” for the use of whoever and whomever and for further examples.

**Exercise 65.** Make sentences with whatever, whoever, whenever, wherever and however after the models given above, and study closely the grammatical relations of these words. However, whenever and wherever are used as conjunctive advv. It is best to regard whatever and whoever as conjunctive pronn., and no matter what, no matter who as conjunctive pronominal phrases.
