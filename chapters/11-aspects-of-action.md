## CHAPTER XI: ASPECTS OF ACTION

### 11.01. The Study of the Verb

The study of the verb and its changes has been often regarded as the most important, and perhaps the most difficult, part of grammar. It is true that the verb is the most important word in any sentence, because it is the verb which gives life to the whole sentence and connects the parts up in a logical whole. Compare, for instance, *She is picking roses in the garden*, which gives us a satisfactory mental picture, with *She roses in the garden*, where the succession of images is dead and unrelated.

Undoubtedly, also, the verb undergoes more changes and requires more careful handling than any other part of speech (compare, for instance, the relative stability of the noun). Just as an action has more complicated relations than an object or a quality, so a verb is subject to more variations than a noun or an adjective. An action immediately presupposes some one who does it (the subject of the action), and it may easily affect some one else or some particular thing (the indirect or direct object). Then, an action always takes place in time, whereas an object or quality does not necessarily involve a time-notion. Finally, the action itself may be of the most various kinds, whether active or passive, continuous or completed, real or supposed, etc.

In usual grammar books, the verbs are divided into three classes, transitive, intransitive and auxiliary; each transitive verb may have two voices, active and passive; each voice may have so many moods, like interrogative, indicative, imperative and infinitive; the indicative and interrogative moods again may have so many tenses, present, past and future, and so many subordinate tenses, like present simple, present perfect, present perfect continuous, etc.

In this book, which is based on notional principles, the verb will be studied mainly under four heads: (a) the Aspects of Action (Chap. XI), (b) Transitive Action, especially the relationships of the subject and object (Chap. XII), (c) the Time of Action (Chap. XIII), and (d) the verbal moods, or Fact and Fancy (Chap. XIV). Thus, except the relationships with subject and object, and the notions and expressions of time and mood, all the other changes will be covered under the term "Aspect."

### 11.02. What is an Aspect?[^1]

An "aspect" of action means a class of action. Actions, naturally, may be divided into different classes. Thus—

- repeat
- reiterate
- return
- recover
- regain

belong to one class of action, in so far as they have all one aspect in common, i.e., all the actions consist in doing something over again or in going back to some thing. The same action or actions may be classified according to different aspects. If we take the word *repeat*, we may look at it from another aspect, and say that it is a transitive verb in having the action extended to some object, as *repeat a song*. In this aspect, *repeat* may be classified with other transitive verbs like *kill (a man), tell (a story), eat (some food)*, which are different from intransitive verbs like *go, come, rest, sleep*. Thus the consideration whether an action is transitive or intransitive may be considered an aspect-notion. Again, actions may be considered as of long duration (*know, remember, love*) or of short duration (*learn, remind, fall in love*). Or an action may be active (*I tell a story*) or passive (*I am told*). There is also a distinction between habitual action (*I smoke a pipe*) and simple present (*I am not smoking today*). Thus the same action and the same verb may belong to different "aspects" or classes. Some aspects are determined by the nature of the verb itself (transitive—intransitive), others may depend on how it is used (active—passive) or on tense-modifications (perfect—continuous).

In every language, certain aspects of action are clearly recognized. Without making clear to oneself these aspect-notions, the proper use of the verb will never be really understood, in spite of the clearest conjugation tables.

Take, for instance, the English distinction between *I wrote* and *I have written*. This is usually classified as a tense-distinction, but the important difference is not one of time, but of aspect. Back of this formal distinction is the aspect-notion, whether an action is regarded in itself (*I wrote*) or with reference to its result (*I have written*). The important thing is to realize the aspect-notion behind these formal changes.

### 11.03. The English Verbal Aspects

The important aspect-notions in English that should be carefully studied and fully understood are the following. (1) The difference between action and condition. (2) The difference between transitive and intransitive action. (3) The difference between active and passive aspects of action. (4) The difference between completed and uncompleted action. (5) The inceptive, continuative and cessative aspects, or the beginning, continuation and end of action. (6) The difference between durative (long-time) and punctual (short-time) action. (7) Habitual action. (8) Tentative action. (9) Miscellaneous minor aspects showing causative, reiterative, reflexive and reciprocal action.

### 11.10. Action and Condition

The first and most important distinction of aspect is the difference between action and condition. It is true that *I am recovering (from illness)* is in the "present continuous tense" and *I have recovered* is in the "present perfect tense." But it is not true that the difference between *I recover* or *recovered* on the one hand, and *am recovering* or *have recovered* on the other, is a difference of tense. The real difference between the two is one of aspect, namely that while *recover(-ed)* denotes an action as such, *am recovering* and *have recovered* denote, not an action, but a condition.

Chinese students continuously confuse the two aspects, and employ the action-aspect far too often, where really the condition-aspect should be used. Thus one often hears such remarks as *You play with fire*, which is highly un-English. The idea is to indicate the condition that you are playing with fire. Such mistakes are extremely common.

- He comes here. (Say *is coming*)
- You make a great mistake. (Say *you are making, or have made*)
- He deceives you. (Say *he is deceiving, or has deceived*)
- I consider this question now. (This is an impossible sentence: say *I will consider or am considering*)
- You fool me. (Say *you are fooling*)
- The child plays alone in the room upstairs. (Say *is playing*)
- I do not smoke this week. (Say *I am not smoking this week*)
- I do not see anybody today. (Say *I am not seeing*)
- I stay at the Y.P.S. Hotel. (Say *I am staying*)
- I must go. (Say *I must be going*)
- He gets better now. (Say *he is getting*)
- He suffers from a headache. (Say *he is suffering*)

One may question why the fact that *I must be going* should be expressed as a condition and not as an action. But it is exactly this peculiarity in English ways of thinking that should be noted. To a very large extent, the present continuous has supplanted, or is supplanting, the present indefinite, whose use is being gradually limited. The fact is, an action often covers a long period of time, so that the action becomes a condition, for which the continuous or the perfect is more suitable. Hence a sentence like *I stay at Y.P.S. Hotel* or *I do not see anybody today* (present indefinite) does not, in the English way of thinking, seem to accord with the truth. The use of *I stay* and *I do not see* seems to indicate only an action lasting a short moment. *I am staying* (pres. continuous) at that hotel not only at this moment, but also this morning and this evening. And if I do not wish to see any visitors today, *I am not seeing* (pres. continuous) them not only at this moment, but also in the morning and in the afternoon.

The present indefinite is, therefore, used chiefly in three connexions. First, to suggest habitual action: as *Do you play tennis? / He smokes*. Secondly, in general statements: as *The earth moves / The moon waxes and wanes / The results depend on your own effort / The balloon goes up by its own weight or lightness / It pays to advertise / As soon as the vessel is filled, it topples over*. In all these examples, really no present action is indicated. Thirdly, where the verb itself is sufficient to indicate a long duration. Many verbs are of this nature: *know, feel, realize, think, understand, fear, hate, love, like, live, be, remain*, etc. E.g., *He knows (feels, sees, realizes) his mistake / I think you ought to go / I understand what you mean / I fear you are wrong / I hate to go alone / He intends to come back / You forget that you owe him a debt of gratitude / Where do you live? / That is a mistake / That remains to be proved*.

Notice that the passive voice invariably indicates a condition and not an action as such: *He is killed / The watch is lost / The jar is broken / I am told / You are not allowed / He is greatly respected*, etc.

It may be said that the tenses formed with the auxiliaries *to be* and *to have* are invariably used to indicate a condition rather than an action.

The past indefinite (e.g., *He took away my umbrella / We won / This happened*) is naturally used more freely than the present indefinite, because most actions belong to the past. A thing either happened some time ago or is happening now. That is why the past indefinite is used as much as the present continuous.

### 11.11. Being and Doing

Among all the English verbs, the verb *to be* occupies a very special position. It may, in fact, be considered a class in itself, possibly with similar verbs denoting the process of becoming, like *become, grow, get, turn*. While the verb *to be* states what the subject is, all the other verbs state what the subject does. This is especially clear in such sentences as:—

(Doing) *He told me to go alone. That was what he did. You left the party in the middle of the dinner. You oughtn't to have done that. You are the only person who likes sour things. All the others don't. Some people go to church, and some don't.*

(Being) *Some people are sensitive to such remarks, others are not. He was afraid to go alone. Indeed he was.* (For further examples of this difference, see §3.40)

The consequence of this distinction is that while the verbs of action may have objects, the verb *to be* can never have an object, but only a complement to complete its meaning (*It is important / He is dead / He is my son*). Consequently, when a pronoun follows the verb *to be*, it is put in the nominative, and not the objective case.

- It is I.
- This is he who started the trouble.
- Who is it?
- If it wasn't he, it was somebody else.

Also, while we can use the auxiliary verb *do* with any other verb (*does not go, does not wish, does not have*), we cannot use it with the verb *to be* (*does not be* is unknown).[^2] The verb *to be* is simply not regarded as a verb of action. The Chinese translation of *tung-tz'ǔ* (動詞) for "verbs," therefore, fits in with all verbs except the verb *to be*. In German, the verb is called a 'time-word' (*Zeitwort*) which is, in this respect, more satisfactory.

### 11.20. Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

This is the usual and the most important classification of verbs. In usual grammars, verbs are divided into the three classes: (1) Transitive, (2) Intransitive and (3) Auxiliaries. The distinction is so important that all dictionaries indicate whether a verb is transitive ("v.t.") or intransitive ("v.i."), for without knowing this, the verb cannot be employed correctly. The essential difference is that a v.t. takes an object, but an v.i. does not. In terms of the aspect-notion, the difference is that, with a v.t., the action passes to another object, while, with an v.i., it stops with the subject. Following are some interesting pairs of intransitive and transitive verbs—

| Intransitive         | Transitive           |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| I fall down.         | I felled a tree.     |
| I rise from bed.     | I raise my pencil.   |
| I lie in bed.        | I lay the book down. |
| He was sitting there.| He set his foot on England. |
| He looks round.      | He sees something.   |
| He listens carefully.| He hears the order.  |
| You are talking.     | Can't you say something? |
| Speak!               | I have nothing to say. |

Other examples of intransitive verbs are: *live, run, go, come, fly, swim, walk, sleep*. The important thing to remember is that an intransitive verb cannot directly govern an object, while a transitive verb can do so. Thus we say *see* (v.t.) *the water* and *enter* (v.t.) *the garden*, but we cannot say *swim* (v.i.) *the water* or *walk* (v.i.) *the garden*.

Many verbs are transitive in one particular context and intransitive in another, and in these cases the difference in usage should be carefully observed. Thus *swim* and *walk* are generally intransitive, but we may nevertheless use them as transitive verbs in the following phrases: *swim the channel, swim one’s horse across, walk the hospital* (= be a medical student), *walk the plank* (= walk blindfold into the sea over a plank on pirate ship’s side), *walk the street* (= be a street-walker). Again, we may say: *talk a language (English, French), talk philosophy, talk nonsense*, but we cannot say *talk a story* or *talk this sentence*.

Study closely the different usage of the same verb as intransitive and as transitive in the following, and note that often such difference in use depends entirely on its association with a particular word or phrase:—

| Intransitive                                    | Transitive                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| I am sure he drinks.                            | Let's drink his health.                       |
| He can't eat now.                               | He will eat anything.                         |
| He spoke at the meeting.                        | Actor speaks his part badly.                  |
| You talk too much.                              | Don't talk nonsense.                          |
| I shall not move (=take steps) in the matter.   | Move heaven and earth. / This moved him to anger. |
| The ship floats.                                | Float a loan.                                 |
| You shall hang (=be hanged to death) for this.  | Hang a picture on the wall.                   |
| The child walks before he runs. / Run for your life. / Hope runs high. / River runs dry. | Run a ox down. / Run him to death. / Run a candidate for office. / Run a boat, a machine. / Run a rope round his neck. |
| He writes.                                      | He writes a letter.                           |
| I believe.                                      | I believe you.                                |
| Do you sing?                                    | Sing a song for us.                           |

It will be noticed that, of the two in each pair, the intransitive usually has a more general meaning, often referring to a general habit or ability: *drink*=have the habit of drinking wine, *speak*=give a speech, *float*=have the ability to float, *run*=have the ability to run, *write*=be a writer, *believe*=be a believer in Christianity, *sing*=have the ability to sing. The transitive use, on the other hand, is always more limited or more concrete, on account of its being definitely associated with an object.

Note also the difference between *consult a person* (請教某人) and *consult with a person* (與某商議) / also *meet a person* (路上遇人), and *meet with an accident* (遇見某事; 出事), *plan meets with success* (計畫成功) / *know a person* (認識某人) and *know of a person* (聞名而未見面) / *shoot a person* (槍斃), but *shoot at a person or thing* (向某人或某物射擊).

### 11.21. Intransitive Verbs and Prepositions

Notice, however, that the difference between an intransitive and a transitive verb is often purely syntactic, with sole reference of the verb’s ability or inability to take an object directly. An intransitive verb cannot have an object, but may have a preposition phrase modifying it. Thus, we cannot say *He comes the room*, but we can nevertheless say *He comes into the room*. Actually *He comes* (v.i.) *into the room* is the same as *He enters* (v.t.) *the room*, and *He was looking* (v.i.) *at the game* is the same as *He was watching* (v.t.) *the game*. Still, grammatically speaking, the intransitive actions of coming and looking are not supposed to have passed into the object directly, whereas the transitive actions of entering and watching are.

Owing to this difference, intransitive verbs are most frequently associated with definite prepositions, so much so that the intransitive verb and the preposition often form a phrase with a very definite meaning. Thus *look at* means to watch, *look upon (it as shameful, as a failure)* means to regard, *look up to* means to respect, *look down upon* means to despise, *look into (a company’s accounts)* means to examine, and *look for* means to search. From the student’s point of view, the important thing is to observe the preposition associated with any intransitive verb and the new meaning which is thus developed. A good dictionary should always indicate what prepositions are used in what connexion.

The Pocket or Concise Oxford Dictionary always indicates clearly the preposition to be used in any particular connexion, and less clearly the transitive or intransitive use of the verbs. An illustration, with explanations, is given here, so that the student may derive full benefit from the use of these dictionaries. E.g., under *dig*, we are told (words in brackets [ ] are added for explanation):—"v.i. & t." [v.i. and v.t.]... "Turn up (soil) with spade or other implement or claws &c." [v.t., because ‘soil’ is put in parentheses]... 'd. [=dig] the soil (down, deep, &c.)' [v.i., because ‘the soil’ is not put in parentheses]... "make (hole &c.) thus" [the fact that ‘hole’ is put in parentheses shows we can say ‘dig a hole,’ therefore v.t.]... "bring (buried object) up or out thus" [v.t.]... "make way into &c. thus" [v.i., we can say ‘dig into’]... "thrust (one’s nails, point) into something or in" [v.t. we can say ‘dig his nails into something’ or ‘dig it in’]... "(fig.) [figuratively] make search (for facts &c., into documents &c.) or find out by search" [we can say ‘dig for facts,’ ‘dig into documents,’ both vv.i., but we can also say ‘dig something out,’ v.t.].

The student should therefore always make a mental note of the particular prepositions used in certain particular senses. Following is a selected list of some of the more useful or interesting combinations:—

- care for person or thing
- touch upon a topic (mention)
- dilate upon topic
- refer to a subject
- hint at possible arrangement
- insist on or upon something
- persist in error
- consist of parts, in doing
- desist from some attempt
- refrain from bad language
- refrain from doing
- shrink from something objectionable
- laugh at person or thing
- laugh over some joke
- live on food, fruit, etc.
- live on certain income
- live for object in life
- hear of news, accident
- hear from person (receive letters from)
- die of illness, shame, by weapon, from a fall
- improve upon something
- bask in person’s favour, in popularity, in sunshine
- play at being a poet
- pass for her husband (pretend to be)
- confess to a feeling, a fault
- dispose of subject, person
- apply to person for permission
- subscribe a newspaper, but subscribe to fund, to a view, theory
- thin, admits of no delay
- deal with person, with subject, in cloth, dry goods, etc.
- look over lesson
- talk over matter
- glance through a book, at a person
- think about subject, of some one absent
- reflect upon subject
- quarrel with person, at some point, on some topic
- remonstrate with person
- reason with person
- come to a bad situation
- lead to a result
- thing happens to person
- stumble upon a discovery
- idea occurs to person
- revelation dawns upon person
- fall in love, fall out (quarrel) with person
- something falls to one’s lot
- burden falls upon person
- wait at table, on or upon (serve) person, for person or thing
- attend to business, guests
- venture upon an undertaking
- send for doctor
- infringe on another’s rights
- consent to agreement, request
- agree to suggestion, with person, on some point
- differ from another
- crave for, long for, person or object
- despair of object
- aim at goal
- comply with request
- argue with person, about topic, against opponent
- correspond with person, but to analogous part or parallel
- abstain from drink, etc.
- what becomes of person? (what has happened to him?)
- object to proposal
- proceed with business
- count on, rely on, reckon on, depend on, support
- matter calls for attention
- yield to person or his demands
- indulge in bad habits.
- plunge into water, new subject, new business
- linger at or around a place, over subject of discussion
- cry over spilt milk
- jump at conclusion
- chase after bandit, girl
- call on person

The above list gives only intransitive verbs with their prepositions. Adjectives, participles and nouns also have their peculiar prepositions. Sometimes two cognate words may require different prepositions, as *derogate from* but *derogatory to* a person’s reputation. Other words may require no preposition as transitive verbs, but require a preposition as nouns, e.g. *prefer something*, but shows *preference for* desired object / *This precedes that*, but *This takes precedence of that* / *consider the poor man*, but *show consideration for the poor* / *dislike a person*, but *conceive a dislike to or for a person or thing*.

### 11.22. Intransitive Verbs Used Transitively

There are certain cases where an intransitive verb is used transitively. These are different from the cases discussed in §11.20, where the verb is used as a transitive verb in certain connexions, and as an intransitive verb in other connexions. Here we are discussing certain intransitive verbs used in some definite ways so that they still keep their meaning as intransitive verbs, but can apparently have an object.

(1) First, we have cases like *dream a dream, die a natural (an easy) death, smile a (sweet) smile* and *sleep the sleep of the just* (i.e., sleep soundly like men without worry), where we do not have a real object, but what is really a repetition of the verb.

(2) Secondly, we have phrases like *smile consent or acquiescence*, which means to express consent or acquiescence by a smile. The consent is not "smiled," but is really only expressed by a smile. Other examples are:—

- She looked her consent.
- He looked the thanks he could not express.
- He said nothing, but looked all love and sympathy.
- Mr. Astor said nothing, but laughed dissent (showed his dissent by a laugh).

(3) Thirdly, and this is the most interesting type, we have cases like *sleep the day away, talk the night away, cry one’s eyes out* and *talk the horse’s hind leg off*. Notice that in all these examples, the idea of *until* is understood (cry until one’s eyes are out, and talk until the horse’s hind leg is off). These may, therefore, be considered as one of the many ways for achieving economy in the English language. Notice that, in all the following examples, the object is some noun or pronoun (often oneself) affected by the action, followed by some word or phrases describing the effect of the action.

- sleep the clock round (sleep until the clock comes round to the same point, i.e., twelve hours)
- sleep off a headache, sleep the headache off
- dream the hours away
- cry one's heart out
- cry oneself to sleep
- laugh a person or idea out of court
- laugh a person out of a bad habit
- laugh him down (silence him by laughing)
- look him into submission, into doing something
- look yourself blind
- look a person out of countenance
- look one full in the face (This case does not imply any effect of the action)
- eat oneself out of house and home (until one is broke)
- drink oneself ill
- drink oneself out of a job (until he loses it)
- drink away the night
- drink a person under the table (until he is drunk and fall under the table)
- drink away one's reason
- talk oneself hoarse (until one's voice is hoarse)
- talk one's way to success (attain success by talking)
- talk a child to sleep
- talk black into white
- talk one to death
- talk him round (until he changes his opinion and agrees with you)
- talk him down (until he yields or gives up)
- talk her into marrying the butler

All these words, *sleep, dream, cry, laugh, look, eat, drink, talk*, are normally intransitive verbs in the sense in which they are used here.

### 11.30. The Term "Voice"

A very important aspect of action, the distinction between active and passive, has been called "voice" in grammar. This name will do as well as any other term, so long as it is taken merely as an empty label. The use of the term, however, should not lead us into thinking that it is in any way different from the other "aspects," or that it has any mysterious function. Its function is merely to indicate an aspect of action. One should merely take it as a label, and not try to read any meaning into it. William James, in his *Talks to Teachers*, relates a story which shows the disastrous consequences of trying to read into the term "voice" an intelligible meaning. A teacher once said to a child, "Suppose that you kill me: you who do the killing are in the active voice, and I, who am killed, am in the passive voice." "But how can you speak if you're killed?" said the child. "Oh, well, you may suppose that I am not yet quite dead!" The next day, the child was asked in class to explain the passive voice, and she said, "It's the kind of voice you speak with when you are not quite dead."[^3]

### 11.31. Formation of the Passive

A passive voice is formed in English by using some form of the verb *to be* and the past participle (p.p.). No matter how varied the passive forms may be, this formula remains unchanged. Compare the following changes of a verb in the active and the parallel changes of the verb *to be* in the passive, and see how exactly they correspond:—

| Active              | Passive              |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Pres. Indefinite I see | I am seen         |
| Past Indefinite I saw  | I was seen        |
| Future Indefinite I shall see | I shall be seen |
| Pres. Perfect I have seen | I have been seen |
| Past Perfect I had seen | I had been seen   |
| Future Perfect I shall have seen | I shall have been seen |
| Present Continuous I am seeing | I am being seen |
| Infinitive to see | to be seen |
| Perfect Infinitive to have seen | to have been seen |
| Participle seeing | being seen |
| Perfect Participle having seen | having been seen |

It will be seen that in the formation of the passive tenses, all that is necessary is to decline the verb *to be* like any other verb while keeping the past participle unchanged.

Usually only transitive verbs can be put in the passive voice, as we can easily turn the active *Jack kills* (v.t.) *Jill* into the passive *Jill is killed by Jack*, but we cannot easily make the active *I sleep* (v.i.) into a passive—*is slept by me*, which would be meaningless. Intransitive verbs with prepositions following, however, may very well be put in the passive voice, as *The accounts must be looked into* (from the active *We must look into the accounts*: see §12.41).

**Exercise 93.** Transform the following active phrases into passive phrases. The active subject may be omitted for practice.

1. We spent a great deal of money.
2. We have spent a great deal of money.
3. They give him the rank of a minister.
4. They have given him, etc.
5. They are giving him, etc.
6. They show a picture to the audience.
7. They will show a picture, etc.
8. They were showing a picture, etc.
9. They have already shown a picture, etc.
10. Having told. Considering. To tell. Without seeing. To have told. Having known. Must realize. Is looking for. Should regard. Will have finished.

### 11.32. Use of the Passive

Apparently there may not be any great difference between *Jack kills Jill* and *Jill is killed by Jack*, which seem to be two ways of saying the same thing. There are many cases, however, where the passive form is necessary or much more preferable to the active form. Thus when a reporter found a man murdered, without being able to learn who murdered him, evidently all he could report would be "A man was murdered in his flat on Avenue B—, etc." For in the passive voice, we can avoid mention of the subject (doer) of the action. Sometimes the doer is unknown (as in the above example), or very indefinite (*It is said*—by whom?), or well understood (*A student was dismissed*—by the school authorities, of course), or of less interest to the hearer and the speaker than the party affected by the action (*A house was burnt*—we are interested in the house burnt and not in the fire which burnt it). Sometimes it is indelicate to mention who was the author of a deed, as in the following examples:—

So the Kuomintang was turned into a personal organ and China was sold through the disgraceful treaty.

I was given to understand—never mind by whom—that no more should be written or published in the papers on this topic.

**Exercise 94.** Learn to use the following very common passive expressions:—

- It is said that
- It is rumoured that
- It is reported that
- I have been told that
- I am told that (to)
- I am surprised to
- I am accustomed to
- He was annoyed at

### 11.33. Active and Passive Nouns

Although this chapter deals exclusively with aspects of verbs, it should be pointed out that nouns and adjectives often involve or imply active or passive action also. The English suffix *-er* or *-or* denotes the doer of a deed, while the suffix *-ee* denotes the receiver or the party affected by the action. Contrast—

- employer — employee
- payer — payee
- addresser — addressee
- lessor — lessee
- vendor — vendee

Notice also *appointee* (person appointed), *nominee* (person nominated for office), *committee* (board to which certain duties are committed or entrusted), *referee* (judge of games, i.e., person to whom questions are referred). The suffix *-er* is very common, as in *fisher, teacher, singer, seeker, finder, receiver, sender, preacher, hawker, traveller, shopkeeper, hair-dresser, mixer of drinks, founder of societies, owner of a car, subscriber to a paper*. Note also *-or* in *instructor, professor, guarantor, sailor, confessor, debtor, creditor, originator*. The past participle in *-ed* is often used as a noun to denote the passive subject, as *the accused* (i.e., the accused person), *the unemployed, the wounded, the deceased*.

### 11.34. Active and Passive Adjectives

Notice also the active and passive action implied in the adjectives—*contemptuous* (鄙視的)—*contemptible* (可鄙的); *desirous* (願望)—*desirable* (合意的); *credulous* (輕信的)—*credible* (近情可信的); *incredulous* (懷疑的)—*incredible* (荒唐難信的); *forgetful* (易忘)—*unforgettable* (難忘); *respectful* (敬意的)—*respectable* (可敬的). The endings *-able, -ible* generally suggest the passive aspect (*eatable, audible, visible, countable, unbelievable, permissible, legible, questionable, understandable, intelligible, digestible*), but sometimes also suggest the active aspect (*susceptible, capable of receiving; perishable, easy to perish; forcible, by use of force*). Curiously enough, *suspicious* has both the active meaning of "prone to suspect" (*He is suspicious by nature*, 生性猜忌) and the passive meaning of "arousing suspicion" (*His conduct was very suspicious*, 形跡可疑). Chinese students often misunderstand the aspect denoted by the words *fearful, frightful, terrible*, etc. It is wrong to say *I am very fearful* for *I fear very much* (a thing, it, is fearful, but a person fears). Thus we have—

| Incorrect         | Correct               |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| I am very terrible | I am very much terrified |
| I am very frightful | I am very much frightened |
| I am very delightful | I am very delighted |
| I am very interesting | I am very interested |
| I am very exciting | I am very excited |

A good dictionary generally indicates whether an adjective is applicable to a person or a thing. Thus a person may be *anxious* (人焦急), but a thing or a situation cannot (事急 = "critical").* A thing may be *interesting*, but generally a person is only *interested*, unless he is *interesting* (as an author or friend) to others. A scene or situation may be *reminiscent* of some former situation (令人迴憶往事), but a person usually cannot be *reminiscent*, he can only be *reminded* of that former situation (回憶往事). Again, a thing or arrangement may be *satisfactory*, but the person is *satisfied*. The student should form the habit of watching whether an adjective is applicable to persons, or to things, or to both.

The very important difference between present participle (active) and past participle (passive) has already been made clear in § 2.33 (a *terrifying* noise, but a *terrified* look, etc.)

### 11.35. False Active

It is gratifying to find another instance of English economy here. Just as the Englishman says *sleep the clock round* in preference to the longer *sleep until the clock comes round*, so he says *The wall looks gloomy* instead of *The wall seems dirty when you look at it*, although we know very well that a wall never does any looking. Here we have a case of false active, used to circumvent the more clumsy expression made necessary by employing the more logical passive.

Not every verb, but only certain ones, can be used this way, and these are so indicated in a dictionary. Following are the more common examples:—

- The book sells well (really it is sold).
- The poem reads smoothly (is smooth when you read it).
- This pen writes very smoothly (really you write with it).
- The song sounds very beautiful.
- That rose smells wonderful(ly).
- This fish smells awful(ly).
- This chicken tastes delicious.
- This window looks out on a patch of green lawn.
- This stove cooks very well.
- The sofa measures twelve feet.
- Mine compares favourably with yours.
- This kind of cloth washes well (stands washing).
- This pipe does not draw easily (you cannot draw the smoke through it easily).

### 11.40. Complete and Incomplete Action

Expressions like *I have eaten* and *He has come back* belong to the conclusive aspect, for they signify that an action has been completed. Here the important idea indicated is not the action in itself, but rather a condition as a result of the action: not that I ate or He came back, but that I am in the condition of having eaten (not hungry) or he is in the condition of having come back (not away or abroad). Such expressions indicate, therefore, a present condition as the result of some past action.

This form, called the "perfect tense," therefore belongs to the conclusive aspect (indicating completed action) and does not primarily refer to time. We could have the same aspect either in the present (*I have eaten*), in the past (*I had eaten*) or in the future (*I shall have eaten*). It is much clearer to separate the two notions of time and aspect, instead of confusing them under the notion of "tense," which is really time and aspect combined.

The Chinese particle *liao* (了, unstressed [lə]) exactly indicates this conclusive aspect, and not the past time merely. 下雨了 means that it is raining now, that it has begun to rain, and not that it rained. 快要下雨了 means that we have already reached the condition now that rain is falling soon (present condition as a result of possible future action). Compare also 米快要完了, which means that rice is running out now, that we haven't got much rice left. 事不成了, 事糟了 (The plan is doomed to failure / The thing has been spoilt) also indicate the conclusive aspect.

### 11.41. Present Perfect and Adverb of Time

Because of this fact that the present perfect indicates a present condition, we cannot, according to the English usage, use it with adverbs denoting past time, although we know very well that the action took place in the past. One cannot say *I have come back yesterday*. The action, it is true, took place in the past (therefore one can say *I came back yesterday*), but we are speaking of the present condition (therefore one should say *I have come back now*).

**Exercise 95.** It is most easy to make such mistakes by inserting an adverb denoting some past time when the action really took place. Correct the following sentences, if they are wrong:—

1. I have met him several times this week.
2. I have met him several times last week.
3. He has lost some money in business last year.
4. We have talked over this matter in his house last night.

### 11.42. Use of the Perfect

(1) The following examples illustrate the proper use of the perfect tense. Notice that they indicate a condition, or a man's experience, record, or achievement covering a long period.

- What have you got there? (present condition)
- I've forgotten what he said in the letter. (present condition: compare "I forgot to tell you.")
- I have not seen more than three such vases in my life-time. (long experience)
- He has travelled a great deal. (present condition: He knows a great deal about foreign countries.)
- I have known him for a long time. (long experience: for this and the following two examples, see § 11.61, "4")
- I have always regarded you as the ablest man of the party. (long period)
- I have always wanted to see you.
- He has repeatedly captured the first prize in college contests.
- In his service as a diplomat, he has shaken hands with kings and queens, (has) sat at the same table with the greatest poets and philosophers, and (has) seen all that is worth seeing in the country. (experience)
- The affair has turned out differently from what he expected.
- I have said what I wanted to say.
- §— has graduated from Nankai. (i.e., He has the standing [资格] of a Nankai graduate: compare "He graduated from Nankai last summer.")
- We have worked together and played together as children; we have quarrelled and made up many times, but we have never ceased to be very fond of each other. (long period)
- He has written several volumes of poetry. (record)
- He has studied at Oxford and Berlin, two of the best universities in Europe. (This is his standing, but in answer to the question "Where did he study?" one merely says "He studied, etc.")
- The mother says, "I have cared for him, sent him to college, and given him the best of everything in life."

(2) The difference between present perfect and past indefinite is illustrated in the following imaginary dialogue:—

- Scrups: Where's Thomas?
- Howard: He has gone away. (present condition)
- Scrups: I didn't know that. When did he go? (past action)
- Howard: He went away on Monday. (past action)
- Scrups: What's he doing? Have you got any news from him? (present condition)
- Howard: Yes. He sent me a telegram from Cologne. (past action)

The points of difference are, therefore: (1) the present perfect refers to the present, while the past indefinite refers to the past; (2) the present perfect denotes a condition, while the past indefinite (except with the verb *to be*) denotes an action; and (3) consequently, the present perfect covers a long period of time, while the past indefinite (generally) refers to a short point of time. We say "Did you see the President?" when we mean to ask whether he saw him or not (as an action), but "Have you seen T— lately?" when we mean to ask whether for the last few days (an extended period) he has seen T—. Consequently, we can say "I saw him just now," or "I just saw him" (point of time), but I have not seen him for a long time (period of time). Notice also such idiomatic expressions:—

- This is the best book he ever wrote.
- But: Of all the books he has ever written, this is the best.
- It was the longest funeral procession I ever attended.
- But: Of all the funeral processions I have ever attended, this was the longest.

(3) In connexion with "since," we always say that since some time ago or since something happened (point of time), something else has happened (period of time): *Since he arrived yesterday, he has not been seen*. This means that he arrived, say, at six in the afternoon yesterday (point of time), but that from that time till the present (a long period) he has not been seen. Study the following examples:—

- Since that quarrel (Since they quarrelled), they have never met (or spoken to each other) again.
- I have not been able to write a single word since last week.
- Lord Lytton has made half a dozen calls since his arrival.
- There have been three floods in China since 1910.
- Husbands and wives have quarrelled since human marriage began.
- Man has sinned since the world began.
- I have not been to Europe since I returned in 1910.
- He has joined the communists since his mother died.
- Many things have happened since you went away.
- He was once bitten by a dog during his childhood, and since then, he has never dared to come near a dog.
- The patient has made great progress since he entered the hospital.

(4) The past perfect indicates the conclusive aspect in some past time, e.g.—
- He had arrived before me (or before I arrived).
- When I arrived, he had signed the check already.
- It had begun to rain before I started, so I was well provided.
- They had decided to go already, so I could not say anything.
- The girl had been neglected by her aunt with whom she was living (consequently she looked very thin, etc.).
- I had not been able to send him any money.
- Still he had not appeared.
- I did not go to meet him, because I had not been notified.

Very often, phrases like *I had intended, I had expected* are used to indicate that what was intended or expected never took place.

- I had intended to call on you yesterday afternoon (but some friend called, so I was not able to go).
- I had expected some help from him (which never came).
- I had thought some sort of arrangement might be made (but later realized that this was impossible).

(5) The future perfect indicates the conclusive aspect in some future time. E.g.—

- At fifty, you will have made enough money to retire comfortably.
- By that time, Freddie will have grown up into a big boy, and Eda most probably will have been married.
- You post this letter now, so that when you go to see him the day after tomorrow, he will surely have received the letter already.

(6) "Have had," "had had." Chinese students are often puzzled by this combination. Really it is very simple, for the first word, *have*, serves as an auxiliary (as in *have come*) and the second word, *had*, serves as a principal verb. In English, *have* as a principal verb can even be put in the passive voice:

- Four can be had at 10 cents a pound.
- Nothing is to be had there (=There is nothing to buy at that place).

Hence its use as a principal verb in *have had* (for the present) and *had had* (for the past) is easy to understand.

- Look here, we've had enough of this. (Don't make any more trouble.)
- Have you had your dinner? Thanks, I've had mine already.
- Waley had had (i.e., had gone through) a most unpleasant experience in his first African trip.

**Exercise 96.** Study the following, giving your reasons for the use of the perfect tense or the past indefinite, and correct the sentences if they are wrong:—

1. Haven't you eaten enough at last night's dinner?
2. I always regarded (have regarded?) this as a risky business.
3. While he was principal of the middle school, he has always been on the best terms with the Bureau of Education.
4. The company became bankrupt, and as a result, the outstanding debts are (were? have been?) left unpaid.
5. A great deal was (has been?) written on the subject of extraterritoriality.
6. News has been (was?) received from home saying that his grandmother is dead.
7. The patient recovered (is recovering? has recovered?) since he came under my treatment.
8. This was the second marriage for both the bride and bridegroom. They both had (had had?) a most unhappy marital experience. Both were (had been?) very unhappy in their first marriage. Since the second marriage, they live (have lived? are living?) most happily together.
9. Of course your suggestion was received with great applause. Nobody had thought of it before.
10. Have you seen the famous spiritualist when he was in Shanghai last December?

### 11.43. Incompletion: Use of the Progressive

There are two tense-forms belonging to the non-conclusive aspect: (1) the "continuous" or "progressive" (*I am writing / You are listening*) and (2) the "perfect continuous" (*I have been writing / You have been listening*).

The present progressive, rather than the present indefinite, is the regular form used for present action, as shown already in § 11.10. We say, "At this moment, some people are dying (not die), some are being married (not are married) and some are being born (not are born) into this world." We also say, "Look here, I am holding (not I hold) this book."

The past progressive indicates that something was going on,—more commonly that something was going on while something else happened. E.g.—

- I was reading upstairs, when I heard the windows shaking and bottles clinking in the cupboard.
- They were dancing and drinking, when the police broke in.
- I was waiting in the station when I saw a woman's face, which seemed very familiar to me.
- I was looking at the sailing clouds when some one slapped me on the back.

Notice the position of *when* in the above examples which is different from its position in Chinese. This is more common than the other arrangement: *When I was looking . . . , some one slapped . . . .*

**Exercise 97.** Translate the following into English, taking care where you put the word *when*.

1. 正在徬徨不定 (hesitating) 之時, 我們看見前面一輛汽車開來。
2. 他正講了一半, 他的太太走出來了。
3. 我正坐在大椅看報, 忽然 A 跑進來。
4. 我們都已熟睡了, 忽然聽見窗外嘩剎的響。

### 11.44. Participles and the Conclusive Aspect

It is the peculiarity of the passive voice that it generally implies completed action. When a thing "is done," then it is done already. If a man "is killed," then he is already killed "If a jar is broken, it is broken already, or if a watch is lost, it is already lost. Expressions of non-conclusive passive voice are comparatively rare, like *A man is being killed, A picture is being shown at the theatre*.

Hence it is that the past participle (used in the passive voice) implies completed action (conclusive aspect) while the present participle (used in the progressive tense) implies incomplete action (non-conclusive aspect). (There is, of course, the further difference that the present participle indicates the active aspect, while the past participle the passive aspect.) Thus by *boiling water*, we mean water which is still boiling, while by *boiled water*, we mean water which has been boiled. A *returning traveller* is still on his way, while a *returned student* has already returned to his home country. Contrast also the *growing boy* and the *grown-up man*. (See § 2.33.)

In order to express the non-conclusive aspect with the passive voice, we have to use the word *being*: *the officer being elected, the course being decided upon*. Hence we have the following scheme:—

| Aspect         | Active             | Passive             |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Conclusive     | having elected     | elected (or having been elected) |
| Non-Conclusive | electing           | being elected       |

**Exercise 98.** Study the following and see whether they are conclusive or non-conclusive:—

1. The man being looked for.
2. The watch lost yesterday.
3. The party exploring the North Pole.
4. The company being formed.
5. The company formed.
6. The judge passing the verdict.
7. The man being tried.
8. The man being held for ransom.
9. The problem being discussed.
10. The house being built.
11. A person having held three posts successively.
12. A person holding three posts now.
13. Three battles fought and won.
14. The war being waged against the communists.

### 11.50. Beginning, Continuation and End

The three aspects of beginning, continuation and end (inceptive, continuative and cessative) are expressed in English by means of the expressions: (1) *begin to, begin —ing*, (2) *keep —ing*, etc. and (3) *stop —ing*, or *cease —ing*.

(1) *Begin to*, etc. This aspect seems to be used in English to a greater extent than in Chinese. On this account, it should be more carefully studied. Say "I begin to suspect" and "I am beginning to think" (疑心起來, 正萌此意) instead of "I suspect" and "I think" when the suspicion or change of opinion is a gradual process. Other examples are:—

- begin to realize
- began to understand
- began to get tired of
- began to repent
- begin to think otherwise
- am beginning to suspect
- am beginning to fear
- is beginning to decay
- has begun to be talked about
- had begun to play

*Begin* followed by a verb in *-ing* is also often used: *begin building at once, began telling me a story, began washing his car*.

(2) *Keep —ing*, etc.

- keep going
- don't keep telling me that
- keep on talking
- remain sitting
- remain living with him
- continue standing

We can say *continue to talk* or *continue talking*, but not *keep to* or *remain to talk*. The double adverbs *on and on* are often used: *He talked on and on / He ran on and on*.

(3) *Stop —ing: stop to*. These two expressions have opposite meanings. *You never stop to think* means that you keep on going ahead and never think, while *you never stop thinking* means that you are thinking all the time. On the other hand, *cease praying* and *cease to pray* both mean the same thing, i.e., stop praying.

- He did not even stop to take a drink.
- A never stopped to look at a lady; B never stopped looking at ladies.
- I have never stopped (ceased) loving you
- Many people cease to study when they have ceased going to school.
- H— has never ceased to believe in you.
- Unless you two stop fighting, I will call in the police.

### 11.60. Point of Time and Period of Time

In point of duration, actions may be regarded as "punctual" (taking place at a point of time) or "durative" (extending over a period). Understanding of this aspect is very important for the proper use of verbs. The difference is illustrated in two sentences already given above:—

- Husbands and wives have quarrelled (durative) since human marriage began (punctual). (§ 11.42, "3")
- I was reading (durative) upstairs, when I heard (punctual) the windows shaking, etc. (§ 11.43)

This durative-punctual aspect is also to be observed in the employment of phrases like *begin to*. It is more exact to say *From that day, he began to lose hope*, than merely *he lost hope*. For losing hope is a long process covering an extended period, whereas the phrase *began to* expresses what took place at a given point of time (that day). So also, it is more exact to say, "From the third day, the patient began to recover, than *the patient recovered*. The process of recovering requires an extended period of days or weeks, whereas beginning to recover could take place at any given point of time.

Only a part of the verbs in the indefinite refer to a point of time, while all the perfect, continuous and perfect continuous tenses refer to an extended period.

### 11.61. Punctual and Durative Verbs

In English, we could find many pairs of verbs or verbal phrases expressing almost the same meaning, but belonging to different durative aspects. Thus we "got acquainted" with a person at a particular time, and then we "know" him for the rest of our days: *got acquainted* is punctual, while *know* is durative. After one once "falls in love" (punctual), then he "is in love" for a long time (durative). We may "wake a man up" in a second, but he may continue to "lie awake" for the whole night. Other examples are: *get* (punctual)—*have* (durative) / *learn* (p.)—*know* (d.) / *remind* (p.)—*remember* (d., also p.) / *receive* (p.)—*keep* (d.) / *get frightened* (p.)—*fear* (d.) / *arrive* (p.)—*stay* (d.). The verb *to be* best represents the durative verbs, while the verb *to do* best represents the punctual verbs. When a man is lazy or dishonest, he is lazy or dishonest even in his sleep. On the other hand, a man may steal something today and yet not steal anything tomorrow. Very often we dislike a person not for what he does, but for what he is. Some typical examples of punctual verbs worth noticing are given below:—

- That reminds me I have still two letters to write.
- It occurred to me we might send Miss Ch— along.
- He went to bed and fell asleep. (The proper way to say 睡覺了 in English is to use *is asleep, is sleeping* or *has fallen asleep*.)
- I came to the conclusion that . . . (Seldom *I concluded*.)

The practical consequences of this distinction between punctual and durative verbs are four. (1) In order to express durative actions with punctual verbs, we have to use any of the durative tenses (perfect, continuous, perfect continuous). Thus *come* is a punctual verb, but we can express an extended action with it by saying, for instance, *I've come to know him*. *Stop* is also a punctual verb, but we can say *I have never stopped loving you*, which refers to a long period.

(2) In order to express punctual actions with durative verbs, we have to use helping phrases like *came to, began to*. Thus *know* is a durative verb, while the act of beginning to know (punctual) may be expressed by such phrases as *came to know, learnt to know, began to know*.

(3) Many durative verbs like *know, understand, think, believe, regard, consider, value, despise, hate, love, fear* are in themselves sufficient to indicate their durative nature. These words generally do not require the continuous tense to express an extended condition. E.g., *I know* (not *I am knowing*) *you are wrong / I despise* (not *am despising*) *that fellow / I believe* (not *am believing*) *he is in love*.

(4) With these same verbs, the perfect may serve to express what is usually expressed by the perfect continuous.

- I have known him for years. (Really equivalent to *I have been making friends with him for years. I have been knowing* is not English. *I have known him*, although in "perfect" tense, does not imply that the act of knowing him is finished or "perfect." I still know him now.)
- I have always believed in your innocence. (This does not mean I have stopped believing in you.)
- I have always regarded you as a talented beggar. (And am still regarding you that way now.)
- He has remained a symbol of honesty and purity to me.
- He has always stood at the head of his class.

### 11.62. Duration in Prepositions

Prepositions, too, are affected by the distinction between point of time and period of time. Of those indicating point of time, *at* and *on* are the most typical, while the more common words used to indicate period of time are *in, during* and *pending*. We say, for instance, *at nine o'clock in the morning*; also *at sunrise, at sunset, at midnight*, but *in* or *during the night*. The use of *on* is worth noticing. It is selective. Just as we think of a bird alighting on a tree (rather than another tree), so we think of a thing as happening on a certain day rather than another day (especially when we say *Christmas falls on Friday*). In this sense, Friday or any day is regarded really as a point of time in comparison with other days. So we say *on that morning, on that evening*, when we regard it as one morning or evening among others, but *in the morning, in the evening* when we regard it in itself as a long period. Notice also the phrase *once upon a time*.

*During* more clearly covers the whole period mentioned: *during the evening, during the week, during the meeting*. *Pending* means "during the interval until": *Pending his arrival* (from this time until he comes), *we shall go on as usual*. *In the course of* implies any point during a period: *I shall pay you in the course of next week*. *By* suggests the passing of time: *By that time you will be quite a rich man* means that you will be getting richer and richer as time goes on, until that time mentioned when you will be quite rich. *Have the dress finished by Saturday* means by Saturday at the latest, and earlier if you can.

### 11.70. Habitual Action

One of the uses of the present indefinite in English is to indicate habitual action: *Do you smoke? / She sings / We play tennis everyday*. These indicate present habits, but the action is not necessarily limited to the present moment. *We play tennis everyday* implies that we played yesterday also. In the case of *She sings*, the meaning is *She can sing*, or *She is a singer*, implying an ability which is not limited to the present only. Some more examples are given below: note that really present action is indicated by the present continuous, as explained in § 11.10.

- He gets up at eight and goes to bed at ten (habitual). Contrast: He is getting up now (present).
- The boy goes to school (i.e., he is a schoolboy—habitual). Contrast: The boy is going to school (present).
- She sends him letters everyday (habitual). Contrast: She is sending (or has sent) a letter to him (present).
- The boat sails fourteen miles an hour (has the capacity). Contrast: The boat is sailing north (present).
- Do you go to church? (habitual). Contrast: Did you go to church? (past action) or, Are you going to church now? (present)
- Smithey never yields (habitual). But he is yielding now (present).
- Joey swears terribly (has the habit of using bad language).

For past habitual action, the most general way is to use the phrase *used to*.

- We used to play together.
- They used to live in the same room.
- The boat used to run between Tientsin and Shanghai.
- She used to stop at Tsingtao for a day or two.
- We used to let off fire-crackers and make new year calls on New Year's Day.
- There used to be a boat race on the Dragon Boat Festival.
- The Chinese emperor used to get up at four o'clock in the morning and hold audience with his ministers.
- We used to meet every Saturday evening in his house.

Strange to say, the negative form (logically *did not use to*) is unknown, while *never used to* and *used not to* are felt to be awkward. The negative can be expressed by *usually not*, or simply by *never*: *Usually he did not turn up / He never smoked*.

The passive form *be used to* requires a noun after it: *I am used to that sort of treatment*. It can be used affirmatively or negatively (*I am not used to that sort of treatment*), and for any time (*I was not used to sleeping on wooden boards*). From this we get the expression *get used to*: *He got used to her piano music and she got used to his smoke / We can easily get used to your pronunciation*.

### 11.80. Tentative Action

This aspect is known in Chinese, but never employed to the same extent as in English. The usual form is *try to*, with the emphatic forms *attempt to* and *make an effort to*. Thus a phrase like *tried to capture the city* is very difficult to translate exactly into Chinese. It may or may not be implied in the phrase 來攻某城 (攻下與否未曾明言), while 試攻某城 is simply not Chinese. The Chinese language provides clearly only for the successful or conclusive aspect: 攻下. Thus *try to persuade* and *persuade* may be translated by 勸 and 勸動了. But how shall one translate such phrases as *try to work hard, try to do your best*?

Notice also the English expressions *tend to* and *be inclined to*:—*The movies tend to encourage crime / He is inclined to be lazy*. These also express the non-conclusive aspect, and are also difficult to translate idiomatically.

On the other hand, we have another form of tentative action expressed in Chinese as represented by 嘗一嘗, 試一試, 打一打, 敲一敲, 碰一碰, 走一走, 問一問. This may properly be called the casual aspect, implying that the action is done casually, without any serious purpose. 跟他講一講, 說一說 means try to persuade him, and if he won't listen, then give up. In English, the nearest approach to this aspect is seen in *take a look* (看一看), *have a taste* (嘗一嘗), *give it a trial* (試一試) and *have a go at it* (碰一碰造化).

### 11.90. Causative, Reiterative, Reflexive and Reciprocal

There are a number of other minor aspects.

(a) Causative action. This involves two forms: either we cause a person to do something, or we cause something to be done: either *We have the shoemaker repair the shoes*, or *We have the shoes repaired by the shoemaker*. Both forms have already been fully examined in § 9.91.

(b) Reiterative action. In English, this is sometimes expressed through the prefix *re-*, as in *reiterate, repeat, rebuild, readdress, reconvert, reconsider, reassemble, reorganize, revalue, re-enter, reopen*. This prefix *re-* is a living one in English, as it can be attached to any verb with the senses *once more, again, repeatedly*, and *back to some former state*. Sometimes the reiteration is expressed by the adverb phrases *again and again, over and over again*, as in *He asked the question again and again*.

(c) Reflexive and reciprocal action. An action may have direct bearing on the doer (subject) himself (*Save yourself that trouble*), in which case it is called "reflexive"; or if there are two or more subjects, the action may have a mutual bearing (*Tell one another stories*), in which case it is called "reciprocal." The expression of these two aspects has already been studied in § 7.23 ("Reflexive and Reciprocal Pronouns").

[^1]: The word "aspect" is a term much used by grammarians in the comparative study of Indo-European languages, but except in the Slavic languages, where the word has a definite meaning, the term has been used to denote the most different things. Grammarians have not been able to agree, and it is not necessary to agree, how many aspects should be distinguished and labelled in the ideal language. This is because certain verbal aspects are recognized in some languages and totally ignored in others. In the study of any one particular language, however, it is entirely possible, and extremely necessary, to note the aspect-notions in that language.
[^2]: Auxiliaries like *must* and *can* also do not admit *do*, but they are not declinable. The verb *to be* is the only declinable verb that cannot go with *do*.
