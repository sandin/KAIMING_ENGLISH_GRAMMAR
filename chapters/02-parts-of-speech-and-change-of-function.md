## CHAPTER II: PARTS OF SPEECH AND CHANGE OF FUNCTION

### 2.10. The Eight Parts of Speech or Word-Classes.

- **Nouns**: dog, book, table, school, John, China, water, sound, work, idea, kindness, strength, anger, danger, order.
- **Pronouns**: I, you, he, her, who, this, those, which.
- **Verbs**: cut, strike, see, think, breathe, feel, know, grow, be, become, must, will, dare.
- **Adjectives**: good, bad, rot, red, lazy, kind, strong, angry, dangerous, orderly.
- **Adverbs**: how, when, why, where, well, poorly, now, never, soon, suddenly, here, already.
- **Prepositions**: in, out, above, under, against, toward, with, without, at, during, by.
- **Conjunctions**: and, or, because, although, unless, since, both...and, if, then, while.
- **Exclamations**: oh! what! ah! there! look! heavens! fire! help! my purse! what a liar!

The above are the so-called Parts of Speech, or eight grammatical classes of words. A part of speech simply means a class of words. There are classes of words, just as there are classes of animals or plants. Thus the words dog, look, China belong to one class, and cut, strike, breathe belong to another, just as we put rats, rabbits and squirrels in one class, and dogs, wolves and foxes in another.

### 2.11. Definitions.

The purpose of a definition is to help us decide what a thing is and what it is not. The definitions of the parts of speech are to help us decide to what part of speech a word belongs. Such definitions are not easy to find, and are often as inaccurate as grammatical rules. But practically we do feel there are eight classes of words, and the following definitions will be found generally useful. We can best decide to what class a word belongs by looking at its grammatical function, i.e., the work it does in the sentence.

(1) Nouns denote things. A thing may or may not be visible (as table, sound, grammar); it may be living or dead (man, dog, pencil); it may be an action or event (a fall, a flood, a dinner, a meeting), or a condition or an invisible quality (sickness, beauty, cunning, danger, poverty).

(2) Pronouns take the place of nouns. Thus in John speaks to his mother, but she does not hear him, the word she takes the place of his mother, and him takes the place of John. In Take this book, don’t take that, the work that is a pronoun taking the place of that book.

(3) Verbs tell what people or things do. (But the words is, can, must, will, have, etc. are also called verbs.) There is not one definition of the verb which is perfect. Generally a verb is the important word which says something and gives life to the sentence. In a good man, the meaning is dead, for we say nothing about the good man, but in He is a good man, or The man is good, the verb is at once gives life to the sentence.

(4) Adjectives modify nouns. They tell what people or things are like. Both in a sick man and The man is sick, the word sick modifies man, and shows what the man is like.

(5) Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs. Adverbs generally tell how, when, where or why a thing is done. Thus in He is running fast, He is running now, He is running there, the adverbs fast, now, there modify the verb is running. In very red and very soon, the adverb very modifies the adjective red and the adverb soon respectively.

(6) Prepositions with the nouns following them form prepositional phrases which modify other words. The preposition itself always shows some kind of relation. There is no preposition which is not followed by a noun or its equivalent, or which does not form a prepositional phrase. In He is in the house, we have the prepositional phrase in the house, with the preposition in. But in He is in (meaning “in the house”), the word in is regarded as an adjective, because it does not have the prepositional function. In the house is a phrase modifying he. In He talks like mad (like a mad man), the prepositional phrase like mad modifies the verb talks. All prepositional phrases are used either as adjectival or adverbial phrases.

(7) Conjunctions join words or groups of words. In he and I, this or that, the words and, or are conjunctions. In You may come this way or that way / You may come or you may go / I will not come until you go away, the words or, until join groups of words.

(8) Exclamations (also called interjections) are words which we exclaim. We make exclamations when we are frightened, angry, or otherwise excited. He a gentleman! (meaning he is not) is as much an exclamation as oh! ah! what!

**Exercise 1.**  
(I) Give proper adjectives for describing students, a lesson, a dress, eyes, song, food, face, as a lazy student, etc. See who can give the best adjectives.  
(II) Give some verbs to show what the following persons or things do: child, mother, teacher, student, dog, cat, ship, water, machine, lamp.  
(III) Use some verbs to show what you do in the morning before breakfast, after lunch, after school is over, after supper and before going to bed.  
(IV) Use the following adverbs in good, short sentences, and tell what they modify: now, quickly, never, always, already, yet, slowly, carefully, suddenly.  
(V) Use the following prepositional phrases, and show what they modify. Are they used as adjectives or as adverbs?  
1. in the garden  
2. into the water  
3. at once  
4. before long  
5. for ever  
6. at sunrise  
7. near the desk  
8. behind the wall  
9. for this purpose  
10. in what way?  
11. for this reason  
12. along the coast  
13. outside the school  
14. after the class  
15. during dinner  
16. at school  
17. under the bed  
18. on the tree  
19. at the beginning  
20. to the end  
21. by no means  
22. in a hurry  

### 2.12. Grammatical Function.

You see from the above that we determine the part of speech of a word by its grammatical function, or by what it does in the sentence. Of course a word may serve different functions at different times, just as a father may serve also as a family-doctor, or a wife may work also as a secretary. Thus we see the words sleep, before and back are used in different functions in the following sentences.

He sleeps. (as a vb.)  
He talks in his sleep. (as a n.)  
He walked before. (as an adv.)  
He walked before me. (as a prep.)  
He had walked a mile before he came to the house. (as a conj.)  
At the back of the house. (as a n.)  
Back parlour. Back pay. (as adj.)  
Stand back! (as an adv.)  
To back up a friend. (as a vb.)

In fact, a word may serve a double function at the same time. In I bought a new hat which you saw this morning, the word which is at once used as a pronoun taking the place of hat, and as a conjunction connecting up the words you saw this morning with hat.

### 2.13. Chinese and English Compared.

In Chinese, most words may serve in different functions without any change of form. Thus we use t’ien as a n. in 青天 (green sky), as an adj., in 天資, 天堂 (natural gift, heavenly palace), as an adv. in 天天 (everyday), as an excl. in 天啊! (Heavens!), as a vb. in 失其所天, when speaking of a woman who has lost her husband (literally, “loses what she heavens”), and as a substitute for the pron. your in 天顏, when we really mean your (or Your Majesty’s) face in speaking to an emperor. In these various functions, the word t’ien itself remains unchanged. Compare also the following uses of the word pch (white): as adj. and n. in 白馬之白 (the whiteness of a white horse), as a vb. in 自白其志 (to explain one’s mind), as verbal adj. in 得大白於天下 (to have made clear one’s position before the public), as an adj. in the adv. phrase 白晝見鬼 (to see ghosts in broad daylight), and finally as an adv. in 白受損失 (to meet a loss without compensation). Sometimes, we do change the form of the word, as luan for disorderly as adj., and luan-tse in nau luan-tse (鬧亂子) for creating disturbance, or making a scandal as a n.

But in English, as a rule, the words change their form with the change in function. E. g., we have admire, vb., admiration, n., admirable, admiring, adj., and admirably, admiringly, advv. Hence, the Chinese student of English must learn to feel a sense of the different parts of speech, before he can use the different forms correctly.

### 2.14. Sense of Function.

There are five points in the sense of grammatical function which must be learnt by anybody who wants to speak correct English without difficulty. They are (1) the sense of thing (for nn.), (2) the sense of action (for vbb.), (3) the sense of quality (for adjj.), (4) the sense of manner and aspect (for advv. and adjj.), and (5) the sense of prepositional force (for prepp.). These feelings have not been trained in the Chinese student, because the Chinese language does not demand a vivid feeling of these grammatical differences. For instance, whether a word is a vb. or an adj. generally makes no difference in Chinese grammar, but the Englishman feels the difference between He fears (vb.) and He is afraid (adj.). The Chinese student must therefore feel the same way as the Englishman does before he can handle the parts of speech correctly and without difficulty.

Through the following exercises, the student will learn to feel the difference between nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions. The other three parts of speech, pronouns, conjunctions and exclamations are easy to recognize and are not so very different from the Chinese. When these are learnt, the student will find it easy to recognize the part of speech of any word he hears or reads.

### 2.15. Sense of Thing.

A concrete thing, like table or chair, is regarded as a n. either in English or in Chinese. But actions (人事), invisible qualities (品性), and conditions (情况) regarded as nn. have peculiar forms which are strange to the Chinese mind. Study the following, and see how the nn. of action and the nn. of quality or condition are used exactly like other nn.

**NOUNS OF ACTION**

I love books. | I love reading.  
Have you learnt this? | Have you learnt swimming?  
The geography lesson is difficult. | Breathing under water is difficult.  
A pocket-knife is useful. | Letter-writing is useful.  
He stopped the car. | She stopped singing.  
I teach grammar. | You teach dancing.  
The boy slept during the class. | He slept also during the meeting.  
Then he slept before seven o'clock. | Then he slept before going to bed.  
He is like his father in his laziness. | This is like playing with fire.  
You learn to punctuate. | You learn punctuation.  
We compose sentences. | We learn composition.  
He is promoted. | We heard about his promotion.  
You were examined. | You passed the examination.  
This is easy to prepare. | This requires no preparation.  
You must not be afraid to repeat your sentences. | Repetition is good for you, but don't repeat mistakes.

**NOUNS OF QUALITY AND CONDITION**

He is poor, but he enjoys his poverty.  
Lovers are blind, but never mind the blindness of the lovers, so long as love lasts.  
He is a good man, but his goodness cannot help him to pay debts. “Goodness” is such a variable term. According to the servant, a “good” master is one who gives five-dollar tips. A cat that catches mice is a “good” cat for men, but a very bad one for the mice.  
His handwriting was so small. I was surprised at the smallness of his handwriting.  
Cleanliness is as important in a cook as beauty in women.  
You choose a race-horse for his speed, and a cart-horse for his strength.  
Honesty is the best policy in business, but the worst in war and politics.

### 2.16. Sense of Action and Quality.

In English, the distinction between vbb. and adj. is vividly felt. This is the difference between “to do” and “to be,” to do an action, and to be a quality.

**Action** | **Quality**  
He studies hard. | He is diligent.  
He works hard. | He is hard-working.  
He looks handsome. | He is nice-looking.  
He fears me. | He is afraid of me.  
He likes to sleep. | He is sleepy.  
He wakes up. | He is awake.  
He grows up. | He is big.  
He laughs. | He is happy.  
He enjoys. | He is pleased with it.  
It rains. | It is rainy.  
The sky clears. | The sky is clear.  
Day breaks. | It is bright.  
Sound frightens. | Sound is fearful.  
Prisoner escapes. | Prisoner is free.  
Master scolds. | Master is abusive.  
Servant fears. | Servant is afraid.  
Man recovers. | Man is well.  
Something hurts. | It is painful.  
Action offends. | It is offensive.

You see with the verbs, we always feel a sense of motion or action, while with the adjectives, we feel a sense of quality, although the two may express the same general idea.

**Exercise 2.** The teacher will give the sentences with the vbb. and let the students try to give the corresponding sentences with the adj. (Notice that we always use is, or some form of the verb to be, before the adj. in the above sentences. The word be must be added after must, will, can, etc. before adj. If to be is not used, some other verb like feel, become, grow, get must be used in the predicate, as feel sorry, become poor.) E.g.—  
You must take care. | You must be careful.  
You have nothing to eat. | You must be (or: feel) hungry.  
He has gone. | He has been away.  
Don't work too hard. | Don't be too diligent.  
I shall prepare everything. | I shall be (or: get) ready.

**Exercise 3.** Put the proper words in the blanks before adj.—  
1. I shall go soon, or I shall soon — away.  
2. You must prepare, or you must — ready.  
3. Has he had many things to do, or has he — busy?  
4. You mustn’t forget your things, or you mustn’t — forgetful.  
5. He had done too much work, and he — very tired.  
6. Let us enjoy ourselves and — happy.  
7. Please — more careful next time.  
8. He has always — late.  
9. Learn to come in time, or learn to — punctual.

### 2.17. Sense of Aspect and Manner.

The sense of manner (情狀) which is expressed by adverbs is not new to Chinese. The Chinese expressions with ran practically always express the same adverbial function. Thus we have 茫然 (vaguely, in a lost state), 孑然 (alone), 漠然 (coldly), 欣然 (glad, gladly), 霍然 (suddenly), 寂然 (silently), 哑然 (with a roar of laughter), 悚然, 凛然 (with a feeling of awe), etc. But the sense of aspect (方面) is rather new: it is now expressed in modern Chinese with the particles 上 and 的. For instance, we speak of the inequality of the sexes, but we may ask in what respect are they unequal, physically, mentally, legally, or economically? This is now expressed in Chinese by 體力上, 智力上, 法律上, 經濟上的不平等. We can also think of a person as physically and spiritually unclean (心邪形穢), and of a girl as attractive in appearance and intelligent in mind (秀外慧中). If a child’s father is a great scholar but ugly-looking, while his mother is a silly pretty-looking doll, it makes a great difference in what respect the child resembles his father or mother. He may resemble his father in his brains and his mother in his looks, or he may be like the father in looks and like the mother in brains. Adverbs and adverbial phrases of aspect answer the question: in what regard? in regard to what? or in what way? This notion of aspect is quite important, because it makes our ideas more exact (Adjectives may also express the same aspect-notion.)

You want to be independent—how? Financially or spiritually?  
In what respect are men and women unequal? Physically, mentally, socially, legally, or economically? Are they equal in brains, in looks, in courage, in patience, in jealousy, in interest, in babies?  
The Chinese are superior to the English in patience, and the English are superior to the Chinese in political organization.  
Po-liang is better than Chung-ing in arithmetic, but Chung-ing is better than Po-liang in old Chinese.  
Teh-lin is the best boy in studies in this class, Fu-ch'u is best in athletics, and Kuo-fan is best in character.  
There is physical courage, and there is moral courage, the courage to say what one believes.  
A man who dare not say what he believes is a moral coward.  
Chinese officials are great men to their families, but criminals to the nation.  
The student is physically weak, but mentally strong.  
Miss B— is desirable as a friend, but not as a wife.  
Playing violin is good as a pastime, but not as a profession.

**Exercise 4.** Learn to use the following expressions:—  
1. in what respect?  
2. in what way better?  
3. in many ways worse  
4. in some way useful  
5. spiritual progress  
6. intellectual laziness  
7. (laziness in thinking)  
8. bodily strong  
9. financially independent  
10. politically free  
11. economically equal  
12. legally right  
13. morally wrong  
14. pleasant as a friend  
15. good as a pastime  
16. useful as a servant  
17. kind in heart  
18. kind in manners  
19. rich in wealth  
20. rich in knowledge  
21. quick in thinking  
22. slow in action  
23. charming in appearance  
24. attractive in style  
25. doubtful in character  
26. laughable in conduct  
27. great in ideas  
28. pleasing in tone  
29. good at mathematics  
30. great at telling lies

Of course most adverbs express manner, time and place. The adverbs of aspect are less common, but are comparatively new to the Chinese as a grammatical notion.

### 2.18. Sense of Prepositional Force.

Go with him. | Walk behind me.  
Go without him. | He comes for his hat.  
Sing for me | He recites without any mistake.  
Sing for money. | She died because of love.  
Look at her. | He died because of her.  
Listen to me. | Get away from them.  
Away with it. | Fight against them.  
Run after him. | Shoot at it.  
Go across the street. | He scolded me for no reason.  
Sit near the fire. | I am opposed to his coming.  
Lean upon the chair. | They parted without saying good-bye.  
Stand against the door. | Are you afraid of being found out?  
Walk through the house. | He could not come on account of illness.  
Look through the key-hole. | I have not seen him since that time.  
Say good-bye before leaving. | You will be punished for doing this.  
He talks without thinking. | We shall fight against opium.  
I am tired of repeating this.

In English, the class of words called prepositions are bound up in idea with the nn. following them, very much as transitive verbs are bound up in idea with their objects.

I fear him. | I am afraid of him.  
Fight them. | Fight against them.

We should read of him as one word, dropping the accent entirely in him, just as in fear him. Chinese students often read him, them too clearly. In grammar, we say the first him and them are objects of verbs, and the second him and them are objects of prepositions. We say the prepositions “govern” their objects, just as transitive verbs govern their objects also. If what follows the preposition is a verb or an adjective, it is at once turned into a noun, as “without saying good-bye,” “before leaving,” “by his kindness.”

(In prepositional phrases like for ever, at once, before long, in short, from abroad, by far, like mad, the words ever, once, etc. are considered nn. by some grammarians. See also § 2.50.)

**Exercise 5.** Learn to pronounce the following correctly, and make sentences with them. Fill in nn. after the prepp. in “e.”

(a) before him (drop tone) | without knowing  
against them | before beginning  
over them | after listening  
through it | through studying  
because of her | by working hard  
one of them | because of having —  
all of us | for being —  
many of them | in reading  
after you (you may be accented) | (d) for ever  
(b) during the class | at once  
all over the place | before long  
since that time | from outside  
in this way | from above  
against my will | (e) instead of —  
in a while | on account of —  
above all | the news of —  
without doubt | lack of —  
beyond any question | for fear of —  
(c) before leaving | followed by —  
after reading | the result of —  
after seeing | the cause of —  
 | the idea of —

### 2.20. Change of Function.

We have seen (§2.13) that in English words often change their form when their function is changed, as bad, badly, badness, or admire, admiration, admiringly. Since this is new to the Chinese student, he must learn how and when these changes are made. Sometimes, of course, no change is necessary just as in Chinese, e.g., he sleeps, and he talks in his sleep, and it would be bad English to say in his sleeping.

### 2.21. Nouns Used as Adjectives.

The use of nouns as adjectives without any change is more common than most of us realize. In this respect, English is quite like Chinese. Study the following:—

stone wall | kitchen door  
cannon ball | carriage driver  
air castle | paper mill  
orange juice | leather factory  
straw hat | book company  
cloth cover | table-cloth  
book-case | sea bath  
silk handkerchief | honey-bee  
country road | milkmaid  
dog Latin (incorrect) | newspaper man  
horse-laugh (coarse) | mail man  
mouse-trap | home country  
fly-paper | hill-path  
middle-school student | fire brigade  
college president | food problem  
Shanghai paper | water problem  
Newfoundland dog | school-girl complexion  
West Lake Exhibition | student days  
Chen brothers | bread-and-butter question  
club fee | Pacific Mail Steamship Co.  
journey expenses | Fukien Wine and Tobacco Monopoly Bureau  
quinine tablet | University of London graduate  
cable address | North-China Herald Office Building  
motor boat |  
motor road |  

In these phrases the preceding n. is always used as an adj. to modify the following n. The relation between them is quite various: stone wall means wall made of stone, honey-bee means bee producing honey, food problem means the problem of food, and fire brigade means a brigade for fighting fire. One should learn this kind of expressions because it is simpler, and helps to make simpler sentence constructions possible. Thus it is easier and more natural to say the nine-o'clock arithmetic class than to say the class in arithmetic which comes at nine o'clock, and it is easier to say the Pacific Mail Steamship Co. (or Co.'s) sailing schedule than to say the schedule for sailing of the Pacific Mail Steamship Co. It is better English to say He owns a paper mill than to say He owns a mill for manufacturing paper. It is more idiomatic to say motor roads than to say motor-car roads or roads for motor cars. A motor road is perhaps less exact, logically speaking, because the road is not run by motors, but it is better English.

In this way, English is so much like Chinese. We say journey expenses for 旅費, China tea for 中國茶, fly-paper for 蒼蠅紙 and Nanyang College President for 南洋公學校長. Moreover, this is often the only logical way. It would be wrong to say fiery brigade, watery pipe, geographical class and tubercular doctor for fire brigade, water-pipe, geography class and tuberculosis doctor. The pipe is not watery, and the class is not geographical, nor is the doctor suffering from tuberculosis himself. In other cases, both forms may be used: college student or collegiate student, China tea or Chinese tea, Japan tour or Japanese tour, and South China or Southern China. The use of the adjectival form tends to describe a quality of the object rather than the object itself.

### 2.22. Nouns Changed into Adjectives.

Besides above highly convenient way of using nn. as adjj., there are regular adjj. which are formed from nn. by adding certain endings or suffixes. Following are some of the common forms of adj. made from nn.

gold............golden (colour) | ghost........ghostly (voice)  
wood...........wooden (bowl) | fog..........foggy (morning)  
earth ..........earthen (ware) | storm.......stormy (sea)  
oak.............oaken (chest) | cloud.......cloudy (sky)  
person..........personal (use) | wind........windy (day)  
verb............verbal (adjective) | rain........rainy (weather)  
nation..........national (custom) | drama......dramatic (literature)  
nature ..........natural (beauty) | patriot....patriotic (heart)  
pig.............piggish (nature) 食欲 | Socrates...Socratic (dialogue)  
sheep ...........sheepish (face) 赤顔 | bearded man  
child ...........childish (idea) | nine-headed bird 九頭鳥  
girl............girlish (complexion) | round-eyed baby  
boy.............boyish (fun) | three-legged cat  
self............selfish (motive) | beautiful girl  
man.............manly (appearance) | powerful man  
woman...........womanly (grace) | fearful disorder  
gentleman.......gentlemanly (conduct) | hopeful appearance  
 | shameful look  
day.............daily (experience) | skilful work  
week............weekly (visit) | powerless chief  
month...........monthly (test) | fearless enemy  
coward..........cowardly (thought) | hopeless case  
miser...........miserly (habits) | shameless conduct

**Exercise 6.** Make sentences with some of the above phrases.

### 2.23. Nouns Used as Verbs.

Some nn. can be used as vbb. without change of form.

They stoned him to death.  
The gun was fired.  
Hand the money to me.  
We must back him up with money.  
We must face the problem squarely.  
He elbowed his way into the hall.  
Mr. Holmes eyed him for a moment.  
The party has been well photographed.  
The judge questioned the witness.  
He is named Peter after his father.

The above examples include only words which usually serve as nn. This verbal use of regular nn. generally comes in to help express an idea which cannot be well expressed by the usual vbb. To “eye” a man (睨視) is to look at him steadily for a moment with curiosity, anger, or suspicion. To “knife” a man (暗計傷人) means also using some underhand method to injure a person. To “doctor” a news despatch (改竄電報) means to change many of its words so as to deceive the reading public. To “monkey” (要弄) with a watch is to play with it like a monkey, with the possibility of spoiling its machine, and to “ape” (效顰) a man means to imitate him as the ape imitates man.

Besides the above, there are of course a great many words which commonly serve both as vbb. and nn., as a cover, to cover up / a quick cure, to cure people / some trouble, to trouble a person / no desire, to desire, etc.

### 2.30. Verbs Used as Nouns.

We have already learnt (§ 2.15) that actions are often regarded as nn. and that vbb. so used generally have an -ing added to them. This is the most common, but not the only way. We may say Talking is easier than acting or To talk is easier than to act. The form with to is called the infinitive of a vb. “Infinitive” means “not limited”: it is so called because it expresses a general action and does not “belong” to any subject. It is opposed to the “finite” or limited vbb., which are limited by their subjects, as goes in He goes, and barks in A dog barks.

It is very common, however, to use the infinitive in a sentence beginning with it. Instead of To talk is easier, we may say It is easier to talk. Here we seem to say It is easier, and then, as if to answer the question What is easier? add to talk. In fact, it is often easier and more idiomatic to say It requires a lot of money to build a fine house than to say To build a fine house requires a lot of money. Thus we get three ways of expressing the action as a n.

A. Talking is easier than acting.  
B. To talk is easier than to act.  
C. It is easier to talk than to act.

**Exercise 7.** Change the way of expressing the following sentences according to the models “A,” “B,” “C” given above:—  
1. Learning English is not difficult, if you know how.  
2. It is not reading that is difficult; it is speaking that is difficult.  
3. Studying immediately after lunch is not good for digestion.  
4. Walking in the sunshine is good for health.  
5. Fishing is pleasant for lovers even when there is no fish.  
6. Going to town is enjoyable when one has plenty of money.  
7. To have nothing to do is sometimes a nuisance.  
8. Telling a lie is more difficult than telling the truth.  
9. It is difficult to remember the last lie that you told.  
10. There is nothing more awful than telling a lie to one who believes in you.  
11. There is nothing finer than to chat with your old friends around a fire.  
12. To call oneself a revolutionary is one thing; to be one is another.

The most common form for vbb. used as nn. is still the form with -ing, especially after prepp., as after seeing, before leaving, etc.

**Exercise 8.** Try to complete the following sentences:  
1. I like ~ing —.  
2. I dislike being — (past part.).  
3. I don’t mind ~ing —.  
4. Think of ~ing —.  
5. She always dreams about ~ing —.  
6. His ambition is being a —.  
7. I left after ~ing —.  
8. You must be careful in ~ing —.  
9. Are you afraid of being —?  
10. What is the harm of ~ing —?

### 2.31. Verbs Changed into Nouns.

Besides the above general way of turning any vb. into a n., there are some regular nn. which are made from vbb. or are closely related to vbb. Can you give the vbb. for the following nn. and spell them correctly?

preparation | development | supper  
dictation | movement | speech  
examination | management | food  
recitation | government | thought  
repetition | seizure | life  
composition | pleasure | knowledge  
supposition | occurrence | belief  
multiplication | trial | receipt  
division | denial | success  
addition | refusal | loss  
admission | betrayal | bath  
expulsion | prayer | breath  
compulsion | dinner | cloth

### 2.32. Pairs of Nouns and Verbs.

Many of the commonest vbb. can be used as nn. without any change, and it is important to notice these, because sometimes it would be bad English to use the form with -ing in the wrong place.

make a promise | have a talk with one  
go for a walk | have a quarrel  
during his sleep | have a hearty laugh  
in your studies | give one a surprise  
after your work | change my dress  
begin the review | make three jumps  
give a blow (strike) | tell a lie  
need more practice | has no push (魄力) in him  
the monthly test | has no pull (勢力) behind him  
take some exercise | have no say (發言權) in the matter  
dream a dream | in full swing (上軌道)  
pay a visit

**Exercise 9** Take some of the above words and make separate sentences, using them now as nn., now as vbb.

There is a group of pairs of nn. and vbb. which slightly differ from one another in pronunciation, the end-consonant being soft or voiced in the vbb. and hard or voiceless in the nn. In the case of [f—v], this difference may be seen in the spelling, but in the case of [s—z], and [ð—θ], the difference is usually not indicated.

**Verbs** | **Nouns**  
[-z] | [-s]  
use [ju:z] (利用) | use [ju:s] (用處)  
abuse [ə'bju:z] | abuse [ə'bju:s]  
close [klouz] | close [klous] (寺院重地或學堂的球場)  
excuse [iks'kju:z] | excuse [iks'kju:s]  
house [hauz] | house [haus]  
advise [əd'vaiz] | advice [əd'vais]  
[-v] | [-f]  
halve [hæiv] (對分) | half [hæif]  
calve [kɑ:v] (生小牛) | calf [kɑ:f]  
shelve [ʃelv] (擱起檔案) | shelf [ʃelf]  
prove [pru:v] | proof [pru:f]  
believe [bi'li:v] | belief [bi'li:f]  
[-ð] | [-θ]  
mouth [mauð] (做嘴勢) | mouth [mauθ]  
teethe [ti:ð] (長牙齒) | teeth [ti:θ]

The pronunciation with [-z] is most clearly seen in such phrases as using, use it ['ju:zin, 'ju:zit], the housing ['hauzin] problem. The distinction between practise vb. and practice n., observed by careful writers, is only an orthographic distinction: the pronunciation is the same for both words.

Another common distinction between nn. and vbb. is by the shifting of accent. In some pairs of words, this is quite generally accepted already. Following are some common examples:—

**Verbs [ˈ-]** | **Nouns [ˈ-]**  
progress [prə'gres] | progress ['prɔngres]  
produce [prə'dju:s] (生產) | produce ['prɔdju:s] (產品)  
proceed [prə'si:d] (進行) | proceeds ['prɔusi:dz] (得利)  
present [pri'zent] (贈送) | present ['preznt] (禮物)  
project [prə'dʒekt] (凸出) | project ['prɔdʒikt] (計劃)  
object [əb'dʒekt] (反對) | object ['ɔbdʒikt] (對象)  
subject [səb'dʒekt] (征服) | subject ['sʌbdʒikt] (臣民)  
increase [in'kri:s] | increase ['ɪnkri:s]  
decrease [di:'kri:s] | decrease ['di:kri:s]  
conduct [kən'dakt] (行, 導) | conduct ['kɔndukt] (行為)  
convert [kən'vɜ:t] (使歸正) | convert ['kɔnvɜ:t] (歸正信徒)  
digest [daɪ'dʒest] (消化,爬梳) | digest ['daɪdʒest] (輯要)  
dislike [dis'laik] | dislike ['dɪslaɪk]  
record [ri'kɔ:d] (登記) | record ['rekɔ:d] (記錄)  
import [im'pɔ:t] | import ['ɪmpɔ:t]  
export [eks'pɔ:t] | export ['ekspɔ:t]  
rebel [ri'bel] (反叛) | rebel ['rebəl] (叛徒)  
protest [prə'test] | protest ['prɔtest]

### 2.33. Verbs Used as Adjectives: Participles.

You have probably already learnt about the two forms of vbb. called present and past participles. A participle simply means a word serving in two functions, as vb. and as adj. We can turn any vb. into an adj. by the use of these participial forms.

The present participle is always formed by adding -ing to the vb. The past participle is formed by adding -ed for the regular vbb. and is quite various for the irregular vbb. The present participle expresses active or incomplete action, while the past participle expresses passive or complete action. Boiling water means hot water that is still boiling, while boiled water means water that has been boiled, which may or may not be hot. We can have iced boiled water, but we can never have iced water that is still boiling. In the same way, a drowning man is just going down the water and not dead yet, while a drowned man has already been drowned. We can hear cries for help from a drowning man, but not from one who is already drowned. Similarly, a stirring speech is a speech that stirs people, and an excited crowd is a crowd that has been excited or stirred by the speaker’s exciting speech. Compare the difference in the following phrases and sentences:—

The book is interesting. It interests me. I am interested in it.  
He was in his room, preparing to leave for Paris. He looked sad and silent, prepared for the worst.  
Taking him for the well-known robber, they put him in prison.  
He was shut up in prison, taken for a robber.  
a heart-breaking story.—a heart-broken girl. a broken chair.  
a growing boy.—a grown-up man.  
a terrifying noise.—a terrified look.  
a connecting verb.—a connected speech.  
suffocating air.—a suffocated man.  
running water. | a run-away horse  
the preceding paragraph. | the following story.  
a crying baby. | unwanted children.  
a repeating watch | a carefully repeated poem  
a printing machine | printed matter

**Exercise 10.** Study the following carefully. The teacher will then use expressions with relative clauses and let the students turn them orally into these phrases. E.g., (teacher) a chair that rotates—(student) a rotating chair; (teacher) an animal that eats flesh—(student) a flesh-eating animal.

washing-woman | flying carpet  
high-sounding speech | man-eating savages  
temporarily occupied areas | decided opinion  
fast retreating enemies | determined lock  
above-mentioned words | a changed appearance  
well-dressed man | changing customs  
clean-shaved face | a long-remembered story  
nice-looking girl | his delayed journey  
rapidly rising reputation | the cancelled meeting  
a laughing face | her divorced husband  
a beginning student | your desired object  
far-reaching scheme | my beloved son  
a subsidized local press | an over-protected child  
dying wish | undeveloped resources  
dying father | “sunkist” (sun-kissed) oranges  
well-disciplined boys | howling monkeys  
on-coming tide | ill-smelling things  
roaring fire | dirty-looking things  
sickening smell | well-written essays  
his broken health | a much-needed book

### 2.34. Spelling of Participles.

Notice the spelling in the following participles. “A” includes words of one syllable, with one final consonant preceded by one vowel letter “B” includes words of two syllables, with the same kind of ending, and accented on the second syllable. “C” contains words ending in -e in the infinitive, and “D” contains some special cases.

(A)  
hop [hɔp] | hopping, -ed [-t]  
stop [stɔp] | stopping, -ed [-t]  
run [rʌn] | running  
put [pʊt] | putting  
set [set] | setting  
hit [hɪt] | hitting  
quit [kwɪt] | quitting, -ed [-id]  
chat [tʃæt] | chatting, -ed [-id]  
can (裝罐頭) [kæn] | canning, -ed [-d]

(B)  
begin [bɪˈgɪn] | beginning  
occur [əˈkɜːr] | occurring, -ed [-d]  
upset [ʌpˈset] | upsetting  
remit [rɪˈmɪt] | remitting, -ed [-id]  
excel [ɪkˈsel] | excelling, -ed [-d]  
expel [ɪksˈpel] | expelling, -ed [-d]  
compel [kəmˈpel] | compelling, -ed [-d]

(C)  
save [seɪv] | saving, saved  
give [gɪv] | giving, given [ˈgɪvn]  
live [lɪv] | living, lived  
come [kʌm] | coming  
use [juːz] | using, used [juːzd]  
suppose [səˈpoʊz] | supposing, supposed  
compose [kəmˈpoʊz] | composing, composed  
believe [bɪˈliːv] | believing, believed  
receive [rɪˈsiːv] | receiving, received  
escape [ɪˈskeɪp] | escaping, escaped [-t]

(D)  
lie [lai] 說謊;偃臥) | lying, lied or lain  
die [dai] (死) | dying, died  
dye [dai] (染) | dyeing, dyed  
deny [di'nai] | denying, denied  
reply [ri'plai] | replying, replied  
travel ['trævl] | travel(l)ing, -ed  
picnic ['piknik] | picnicking, picnicked [-t]  
mimic ['mimik] | mimicking, mimicked [-t]

### 2.35. Verbs Changed into Adjectives.

Some regular adj. are formed from vbb. The most common ending is -able, or sometimes -ible, which gives adj. similar in meaning to Chinese adj. 可愛的, 可憎的, 可憐的, etc. Examples of adj. with the -able and -ive endings are:  
eatable | lovable, loveable | active  
unthinkable | laughable | talkative  
unbelievable | terrible | possessive  
desirable | permissible | relative  
allowable | visible [可看見] | suggestive [含意猥褻]  
excusable | audible [可聞見] | extensive [廣大]  
changeable | legible [可讀得] | impulsive [躁急]

All these adj. may be changed again into adv. by adding -ly, or changing -le into -ly (see § 2.42).

### 2.40. Adjectives Changed into Nouns.

We have seen (§ 2.15) that nn. like blindness, kindness, strength, poverty may be formed from the adj. blind, kind, strong, poor. We thus think of these invisible qualities as independent nn. We must learn these nn. because nn. often enable us to make shorter sentences, which are more easily pronounced. I have no fear of his power is a shorter and more comfortable way of saying than I am not afraid although he is so powerful. And I do not know its length is simpler than I do not know how long it is. Also I was impressed by her kindness saves us the trouble of saying by her kind words, by her kind tone, by her kind looks, or by her kind treatment, all of which probably do not exactly express what I mean. Probably I really mean that I was impressed by the fact that she was so kind, and certainly this is better and more easily expressed by using the phrase by her kindness.

Study the following:—

strong.....strength | brave ....... bravery  
long.......length | savage.......savagery  
broad......breadth | diligent ... diligence  
wide........width | obedient...obedience  
cleanly....cleanliness | patient....patience  
kind........kindness | ignorant...ignorance  
cold.........coldness | private....privacy  
sweet.......sweetness | secret......secrecy  
faithful....faithfulness | rapid.......rapidity  
sorry........sorrow | stupid......stupidity  
angry........anger | punctual...punctuality  
hungry......hunger | real.........reality  
proud........pride | united...... unity  
hot...........heat | festive ..... festivity

**Exercise 11.** Use nn. for the adj. in the following sentences, changing the form of the sentence in any way you like.  
1. He ought to be rewarded for being so diligent.  
2. I am not ashamed that I am poor. (ashamed of + n.)  
3. He is a brave man. I admire him for it.  
4. Don't you know she is famous because she is beautiful?  
5. Everybody knows that he is proud.  
6. His great defect is that he is so bad-tempered.  
7. A child should learn to be obedient.  
8. It is not a virtue to be punctual in China.  
9. I cannot understand why he is absent for so long.  
10. He is so generous that he is famous for it.  
11. What we want is that we should all be united.

### 2.41. The Poor, the Dead, etc.

The English language has a way of using expressions like the poor, the rich, the strong, the oppressed to denote a class of things or persons. This also saves us the trouble of stating exactly what the objects are, and this way of stating a whole class is likely to be more accurate. When we say the oppressed, we mean all that are oppressed, whether they are farmers, rickshaw coolies, small shop-keepers, or newspaper editors. Some examples of these expressions are:—

The living and the dead. | The oppressors and the oppressed.  
The rich and the poor. | Turn to the right, to the left.  
The false and the true. | A search for the unknown.  
The righteous and the wicked. | The young ought to be housed and fed.  
The meek and the humble. | None but the brave deserve the fair.  
The lame, the halt and the blind. | You are trying the impossible.  
The modifiers and the modified.

These expressions mean the same thing as those that are poor, those that are living, etc., and are very convenient to use. The same ideas are often expressed with the help of the word one, as the young ones, the fat ones, etc. They correspond to the Chinese notion of 者 in 强者, 弱者, 贫者, 富者, 生者, 死者, etc.

Sometimes, some adj. are used as nn. without any change, as Chinese for the Chinese language or the Chinese people. You are a dear is more expressive than You are dear. I may also mention the unmentionables by which some English ladies mean trousers. Other instances are:—

eatables [食物] | the ancients [古人]  
drinkables [飲料] | the moderns [現代人]  
valuables [貴重物品] | (im)movables [(不)動產]  
sweets [糖食] | the immortals [不朽者]  
the French [法人] | the natives [本地人]  
the English [英人] | the whites and blacks [白種人與黑種人]  
 | the white of an egg [蛋白]  
 | the white of the eyes [眼白]  
 | a red [赤俄,共產黨,紅軍兵士]  
 | the green [公共草地]

### 2.42. Adjectives Changed into Adverbs: the Ending -ly.

In English, adj. are changed into adv. generally by adding -ly. Thus we say complete ignorance (adj.—n.), but completely ignorant (adv.—adj.); unusual luck (adj.—n.) but unusually lucky (adv.—adj.). We also say beautiful singing, but She sings beautifully. Thus the ending -ly becomes a general sign for adv. (compare, however, §2.22, man—manly, etc.). The student should remember to make this change when using such adverb modifiers. A good writer generally knows how to use his adv. Compare the following:—

**Adj. + Nn.** | **Adv. + Adj.**  
fearful dirt | fearfully dirty  
awful noise | awfully noisy  
total ignorance | totally ignorant  
sudden illness | suddenly ill  
great surprise | greatly surprised  
unspeakable joy | unspeakably joyful  
supreme happiness | supremely happy  
gradual increase | gradually increasing  
fatal wound | fatally wounded  
moral responsibility | morally responsible  
blissful ignorance | blissfully ignorant  
rightful place | rightfully there  
wrong accusation | wrongly accused

The words hard, dead and fast may be used as adv. without adding -ly, as run fast, dead tired, dead asleep, work hard. Hardly (adv.) has a totally different meaning equal to “almost not.” Its meaning is really negative: I can hardly hear you means I almost cannot hear you and you must talk louder.

That is hardly enough (=not quite enough).  
I hardly think so (=I almost do not think so).  
I can hardly believe it (=it is difficult to believe).  
There's hardly a soul there (=almost no one there).

Scarcely means the same as hardly.

**Exercise 12.** Make sentences with the following:—  
1. think clearly  
2. act quickly  
3. feel keenly  
4. walk slowly  
5. turn quickly  
6. can hardly believe  
7. hardly believable  
8. utterly useless  
9. certainly right  
10. easily the first  
11. probably there  
12. possibly true  
13. am dead against [極力反對]  
14. dead drunk [泥醉]  
15. dead tired [疲極]  
16. scarcely enough  
17. hopelessly ill  
18. desperately poor  
19. entirely wrong  
20. greatly mistaken  
21. awfully busy  
22. terribly busy  
23. divinely beautiful  
24. shockingly bad

### 2.43. Knowingly, Decidedly, etc.

Participles, too, may form advv. with the ending -ly. Study the following:

You are undoubtedly right.  
He is decidedly wrong.  
Cases of malaria are becoming increasingly frequent.  
He answered knowingly (=in a knowing manner).  
He is admittedly (or: confessedly) a thief.  
We saw an amazingly clever magician.  
The people were all talking confusedly.  
Eat sparingly (=don't eat too much).  
The letter was surprisingly well written. (=I did not think he could write it so well).  
The King then reputedly sent him a cheque for £17,200!

The “e” is pronounced in the -edly combination, although it may not be pronounced in the participles: thus confused [-zd] and marked [-kt], but confusedly [-zidli] and markedly [-kidli], as in markedly different.

### 2.50. Prepositions Used as Adjectives.

In English, the short words called prepositions are very useful, and one should learn to use them in order to make one’s language idiomatic. Thus put the dress on is more idiomatic than wear the dress, and put the light out is more commonly used than extinguish the light. Following are examples of prepp. used as adjj.—

The light is out.  
The game is on (=being played now).  
The meeting is off (=cancelled).  
His mind is off (=crazy).  
We are off at last.  
Is he in (=in the house)?  
No, he is out (=not at home).  
Dinner is over (=finished).  
I am through with you (=I will have no more to do with you).  
She is up (=She has got up from bed).  
Is the meeting over (=finished) now?

There are also some adjj. which are often used like prepp. We may say in cannot do it like you, and do not talk like that, the word like is a prep. and like that, like you are prepositional phrases used in adverbial functions. Yet in It looks like going to rain and He is like his father, the word like still has a very clear adjective function. We may call like in these cases a prepositional adjective, or an adjective with the prepositional power of governing a noun.* Also the word near is often used as an adj. (He is nearer to us) and as a prepositional adj. (The man near her, He is nearer us).* On the other hand, far can never be used as a preposition (far from here, far from it, but never far it). This shows that language is the product of usage and not of logical deductions, and that, in the study of grammar, our work should be based on a careful observation of the many living facts of the language, rather than on a foolish belief in abstract grammatical rules.

* See Fowler: Modern English Usage, p. 325, and Pocket Oxford Dictionary, under like.  
* See Pocket Oxford Dictionary under near.

### 2.51. Adverbs and Prepositions Used as Nouns.

The ups and downs (=rises and falls) of fortune or landscape.  
Have a down (=prejudice or dislike) on a person.  
Know all the ins and outs (=true details).  
Go into whys and wherefores (=reasons) of it.  
We know neither our whence nor our whither (origin and destiny).  
Compare the pros and cons (Latin prepp.=for and against).  
Once is enough. For this once.  
The outside. The inside. The above.

Notice also phrases like for ever, at once, before long, in short, by far, from above, from under with the words ever, long, etc. treated like nn. (§ 2.18).

### 2.52. Adverbs, Prepositions and Conjunctions.

In English, the parts of speech, prepositions, conjunctions and exclamations, (and generally adverbs also), do not change their form. Hence in these words, the change in function does not involve a change in form.

He walked before. (adv.)  
He walked before me. (prep.)  
He had walked a mile before he came to the house. (conj.)

Here the meaning and form of before remain the same. Only by looking at its function can we see a difference in its usage in the three sentences. Many advv. and prepp. may be used interchangeably, while a few may serve also as conjunctions. As there is no change in word-form, this should give the Chinese students no trouble.

He stood outside the door. He stood outside.  
Mr. P— was sitting above. He was sitting above me.  
Soon the ship went under. She went under the water.  
Mr. Y— was walking in front of me. He was walking in front.  
He has left since. He has left since Monday morning. He has left since a message came for him.

### 2.60. Some Interesting Compound-Words.

While we are studying the change in the function and formation of words, it is interesting to notice certain compound-words. In such compound-words, the whole combination may be treated as one word serving one definite grammatical function, without any change in the different parts themselves. This is another point where English is so much like Chinese. Thus we speak of a three-foot ladder, or a go-to-meeting coat or a happy-go-lucky policy. Here the words happy, go and lucky are joined in a manner which is impossible in ordinary combinations. Other extreme instances are the never-to-be-forgotten affair, with an I-turn-the-crank-of-the-Universe air (as if I were the lord of the universe), and a comfortable as-it-was-in-the-beginning-is-now-and-ever-shall-be feeling (a feeling of blessed security), and the-dog-in-the-manger attitude (keeping everything for oneself). Thus we have pickpocket and tooth-pick just like Chinese 扒手, 牙籤, well-to-do (adj.) and ne'er-do-wells (n.) just like Chinese 小康, 無賴, and bread-and-butter marriage, like Chinese 酒肉朋友, 柴米夫妻. In fact, such combinations can be made even more freely in English than in Chinese.
