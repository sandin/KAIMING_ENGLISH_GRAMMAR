## CHAPTER XIV: FACT AND FANCY

### 14.10. The Verbal Moods: Close Relation to Sentence Moods

The usual classification of verbal moods is as follows:—

- (1) Indicative: I come / I shall come.
- (2) Imperative: Come!
- (3) Interrogative: Will you come?
- (4) Subjunctive: If he come.
- (5) Infinitive: To come.

The indicative mood is used for making statements, the imperative is used for giving commands, the interrogative for asking questions, the subjunctive for stating suppositions, and the infinitive for stating actions without any particular subjects.

These verbal moods are but certain forms in the employment of vbb. They do not conflict with the "sentence moods" studied in Chapter III, but help to form them. The interrogative mood is naturally used in forming an interrogative sentence, and the imperative mood is used in sentences which are commands, etc.

### 14.11. Fact and Fancy

Among verbal moods mentioned above, the only one that has peculiar forms is the subjunctive mood (if he come / if I were). But this subjunctive mood is important not only because of its peculiar forms. From the notional point of view, it represents a very important psychological distinction between fact and fancy in the speakers of the English language, a distinction which is not observed in Chinese.

### 14.12. Subjective and Objective Moods

From a notional point of view, we may divide the verbal moods into two classes: subjective (主觀) and objective (客觀). He came, for instance, is a bald statement of an objective fact; He might come / He would come / if he should come are statements of subjective judgments. In That is a mistake, the vb. is is definitely used to state a fact (although it may involve a subjective judgment), but in That must be a mistake / That would be a mistake / That might be a mistake, the vbb. must be, would be and might be state only subjective opinions.

The "subjective moods" may also be called "potential moods" (see §§ 3.71-3.77). They cover a wider field than the old term "subjunctive mood." For instance, in I hope you will come, will come is really a subjective statement (a hope) although in form it is said to be in the indicative, and not the subjunctive, mood.

### 14.20. The Subjunctive Mood: Shifting of Tense

It is necessary to study the forms of the subjunctive mood first. We have the following forms:—

- (1) If I had known. (Past)
- (2) If I knew. (Present)
- (3) If I don't come home tonight. (Future)
- (4) If I (should) know. (General)

In addition, we have to examine the subjunctive forms of the vb. to be (if he be / if he were / if he was).

It will be noticed that there is a shifting of tense in the subjunctive mood. The past perfect is used for the past, the past for the present, and the present for the future. Form (4) will be discussed separately (§ 14.21).

Contrast the following subjective and objective statements:—

OBJECTIVE                      SUBJECTIVE
It was a failure.              If it had been a success.
It rained yesterday.           If it hadn't rained.
I knew nothing about it.       If I had known.
I know nothing about it.       If I knew.
That is a lie.                 If it was a fact.
I have only a dollar left.     If I had more.
He thinks so.                  If he thought otherwise.
You are studying English.      If you were studying French.
I shan't come home tonight.    If I don't come home tonight.
It will rain.                  If it rains tonight.
War will break out soon.       When it breaks out next week.
You will see him tonight.      When you see him.

Exercise 109. Finish the following sentences in the subjunctive mood:—

1. He forgot to bring a dictionary. If he . . . not . . .
2. I stopped him. If I . . . not . . .
3. It rained last night, as you could see the road is wet. If it . . . not . . .
4. I have very little money. If I . . .
5. He is very clever, but a little too talkative. If he . . .
6. (I am not in your place.) If I . . . you . . .
7. Don't let him know. If he . . .
8. I shall go and see him. And if I . . . not find him . . .
9. What will you do, if you . . . (die? shall die?) tomorrow?
10. She will marry him, no matter what . . . (happens? will happen?)

### 14.21. General Supposition: If He Should Have, If He Have

The word "should," as is already discussed in §§ 3.76 and 13.60, is used for stating general suppositions. The form it . . . should is probably the one most commonly used for this purpose.

If you should ever need money.
If there should be (Should there be) a vacancy.
If he should forget.
If I should die now.
If he should become the president.
If you should be interested in this matter.
If that should be the case.
If there should be a war between China and Japan.
If some one should say to you today.
If you should win the champion sweepstakes.

As has already been pointed out, these sentences do not refer to any particular time, although sometimes a time may be indicated. We may say that these are general suppositions, belonging to the general tense.

Furthermore, should is also used in connexion with lest, for fear, in case, and other subjective clauses.

I shall send him a written word, lest he should forget.
Lest you should think I was unwilling to help you, I am enclosing herewith some money.
I am putting the money in different banks, in case (lest) some of them should fail.
He is doing it for fear (lest) people should misunderstand him.
In case you should need my help, just let me know.

Having made this clear, we may proceed to study the English subjunctive forms: if he come / if he be / if he have. Such forms are not in common use at present in standard English (which prefers if he comes / if he is / if he has, or if he should come / if he should be / if he should have). Because they are out of the way, the usual grammars pay more attention to them than is necessary. Such forms may be considered as the equivalents of the forms if he should come, with the should omitted. That is to say, whenever such forms occur, it is always possible to insert the word should in it. For example,—

If it be said that, etc.=if it should be said that, etc.
Although it be the last thing I desire=although it should be, etc.
Lest he hear about it=lest he should hear, etc.
Suppose that he return you the money=suppose he should return you, etc.
The court ordered that he leave the city at once, or that he be hanged to death=the court ordered that he should leave, etc., or that he should be hanged.
He agreed to go, on the condition that his family expenses be (=should be) well provided for.
The widow was bequeathed the whole estate, provided she remain (=should remain) unmarried.

Exercise 110. The word "should" is very often used in all statements that do not definitely state a fact, as It is proper that you should, etc. Make sentences with the following phrases:—

1. If . . . should . . .
2. What if . . . should . . . ?
3. Should there be a . . .
4. How should I . . . ?
5. I would . . . whenever he should . . .
6. Should you . . . , would you . . . ?
7. Lest . . . should . . .
8. In case he should . . .
9. For fear he should . . .
10. It is proper that . . . should . . .
11. It is not right that . . . should . . .
12. It is beyond my understanding that . . . should . . .
13. I am thinking whether . . . should . . .
14. I do not doubt that you should be able to . . .
15. It is incredible that . . . should . . .
16. Don't you think you should . . . ?
17. I can't understand why . . . should . . .
18. I can't believe that . . . should . . .
19. It was his mother's idea that he should . . .
20. It was our plan that . . . should . . .

### 14.22. Different Degrees of Supposition

Attention has already been called to the existence of several subjunctive forms (§ 3.77). In a simple sentence referring to the present, we could use the following forms:—

- (1) If he comes
- (2) If he come (if he should come, should he come)
- (3) If he came

The question is, how should one distinguish them in actual use? In order to understand this, we should know that there are different degrees of supposition, from a supposition which may quite possibly be true (if he comes), to a purer form of supposition (if he should come) and even a supposition which is definitely untrue (if he came for the present, and if he had come for the past). Just what degree of supposition is used depends entirely on the intention of the speaker.

(1) Past suppositions are untrue. Past events are facts (see § 13.40). Hence whether a statement in the past tense is true or untrue is generally known, and an imagined or supposed event in the past is known to be untrue. This is easily seen in the following examples:

If it had rained last night, the roads would be wet. (It did not rain last night.)

If I had not stopped him, he would have been killed. (I did stop him.)

(2) Future suppositions are uncertain. Future actions or events have not yet taken place, and therefore future statements seldom state a fact, but a wish (I will go), an obligation (I have to go), a possibility (I may go), or an expectation (I shall go). In any case, there is almost always a strong subjective element (see § 13.30). The subjunctive form (if it rains tomorrow: also general tense-form, if it should rain tomorrow) always implies an uncertainty.

(3) Present suppositions vary. The most common form used is the ordinary indicative: if he comes. When a greater degree of supposition is meant, the general tense-form if he should come (now) is used. This may be called a purer form of supposition. If he come (instead of if he should come) is used with still greater subjective effect, as in arguments: even if he come / though he be a millionaire / provided he obey strictly my orders. A more direct and still purer form of supposition is if he came, or even if he came, which almost always implies that the supposition is untrue.

Exercise 111. Decide which form should be used in the following sentences, and examine the degree of supposition involved, whether it is possible, supposed, or untrue. Notice that the ordinary indicative is very often used for the present.

1. What if I don't (didn't?) want to help you?
2. What does it matter, even if it is (was?) true?
3. I will have that treasure searched for, even if it cost (should cost? costs?) me a hundred thousand dollars.
4. What can (could?) he do, even if you refuse (refused?) him?
5. Go and see if he is (be? was?) here.
6. If we want to obtain government by law, we must see to it that corrupt officials are (be?) duly punished.
7. If he ever comes (should ever come?) back, do not take him in.

### 14.23. If I Was, If I Were

In the case of the vb. to be, an additional distinction is made between if I was and if I were (also if he was, if he were) for the present. Both state probably untrue suppositions, but I were, he were emphasize their untrue character more than I was, he was. However, both forms are quite in common use in modern English, sometimes almost without distinction.

He could not know everything unless he was a god. (In this connexion, was is perhaps preferred to were.)
If I were you, I wouldn't tell him about it. (In this phrase, invariably were)
Even if I was (or were) here, what could I do?
It were better (short for it would be better) that you never saw him again.
I know that if he was here, he would deny it.

### 14.30. The Potential Moods

The "potential moods" are but another name for the subjective moods. In Chapter III (§§ 3.71-3.77), the potential moods of sentences have already been studied. These moods cover all subjective statements of wish, command, request, doubt, fear, hope, judgment, advice, need, courage, presumption, conjecture, possibility, and other kindred statements. Here we shall review them once more, with special regard to the verbal forms used. They do not always employ the subjunctive form, but generally require some auxiliary or helping vb.

(1) Command, request, suggestion. The subjunctive form is most frequently used with this class of statements. The present tense (usually called "subjunctive present") is used even for the past tense.

The Captain commanded that he go at once. (Go = should go, see § 14.21.)
It is requested that the patient be (not is) allowed to have home food brought to him.
I suggest that you go (not will go) and fetch him.
It is the people's desire that the king resign (=should resign) and be (not is) replaced by his nephew.

(2) Condition and Concession. The subjunctive (past or present) is often used, though the ordinary indicative is perhaps more common. For their choice, see § 14.22.

CONDITION:—

I don't know if this be (or is) true.
If it come (=should come or comes) to that, I would fight it out in court.

CONCESSION:—

Although she is (indicative) rich, she is not happy. (It is a fact that she is rich.)
Though she be (subjunctive) the richest woman in town, she would not be satisfied. (A supposition.)
You have done very well, although you might (or could) have done better.
Still I am not for it, although all that you say may (or might) be quite true.

(3) Wish. A wish often refers to an untrue supposition, and therefore the past tense is quite generally used, (see § 14.22, form "3"). See also § 3.73.

I wish I knew.
I wish I were dead.
I wish I were in your place.
I wish you would (or could) come. (Not will.)
But: May God bless you! May the Devil take you!

(4) Hope, fear, doubt. These often involve forecast of future events, and therefore very naturally employ the future will (2nd and 3rd persons) and shall (1st person).

I doubt whether I shall be able to do it.
I have no doubt he will be able to do it. (Is able is also correct, but less common.)
I am afraid I shan't be able to come.
I'm afraid that will be the end of his romance.
I hope you will come. (But: "I hope you are satisfied"—referring to the present.)
We hope that China will become (not becomes) a strong nation.
There is no doubt he is the best boy of the class. (Referring to the present.)

(5) Judgment and supposition. This has been fully covered in §§ 14.21-14.22 already. The purer the supposition, the more the subjunctive form is used. "That might be true" has a stronger subjunctive connotation than "That may be true." Compare "I suppose he can do it and I know he is going to do it" with "I suppose he could do it, if he wanted to."

(6) Obligation. In British usage, ought is quite often used, much more so than in American usage, which often uses should instead.

You oughtn't to do it.
You ought not to speak like that.
I ought to have told you.

(In American dialects the vulgar form had ought is often used for the past tense.)

(7) Conjecture. In making conjectures about unknown things, can (or could) is usually used in the negative sense, while must is usually used in the affirmative sense.

It cannot be due to his ignorance.
The mistake must be intentional.
It could not have been stolen by some burglar.
It must have been stolen by some one among the servants.
Yes, I think that must be true.
That must be a mistake.
No, it cannot be a mistake.

(8) Possibility. May or might is used according to the circumstances or the degree of supposition.

That may be your last chance.
He might still succeed.
You might burn down the whole house.
He may recover.
If I give you all the money now, you may spend it all.
