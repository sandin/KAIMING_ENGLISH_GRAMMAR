## XII. SUBJECT AND OBJECT (TRANSITIVE ACTION)

### 12.10. Subject and Doer

We shall now see the relation between the subject, the object, and the vb of action. It should be realized that the “subject” of a vb and the “doer” of an action are not always the same thing. It is true that, ordinarily, the subject is the doer of an action, as in He teaches English / She plays piano. But in the passive voice, we immediately see that this is not true, as in I am told, and the officer has been impeached, where the subjects I and officer do nothing whatsoever, but are only affected by the actions mentioned. Also in This is a book, no action is implied at all: the subject this does nothing.

A subject is usually defined as the person or thing we talk about, while all that is said about the subject is called the predicate, (vb. and object included). This general definition will do for practical purposes, although in He teaches English, we really talk about the teaching (vb.) and what is taught (object), as well as about the person who does the teaching (subject).

It should be realized, therefore, that the notion “subject” is purely grammatical. It indicates merely a certain grammatical function in a sentence. English vbb. always require a subject, whereas Chinese vbb. don’t. In English, we say It rains, although we do not know what rains, perhaps “heaven,” perhaps (still better) the rain itself. In Chinese, we are not compelled to find or express the subject of the vb. when it does not exist, as, for instance, in 下雨了 (compare 雨下了), 不行了, 不對了. We also say 有一次, 有一天, where we do not really know what is the subject of the vb. 有

### 12.11. Object and Party Affected

The object is always the party affected by the action. In He told me, of course the object me indicates the person affected by the act of telling. But, conversely, the party affected is not always the object: it may be the subject of a passive vb., as I in I am told. Notice also that, with the vb. to be, where no action is indicated, there is no party affected, and consequently no “object,” but only a “complement”: as in He is her husband, where her husband merely completes the meaning of is (see § 9.90).

An object is affected by an action usually, but not always, as the receiver of the action. In He opens the door, of course the object door directly receives the action, as it were. But there are two special kinds of objects, which are affected in a different way. The first is the object of result, as in dig a grave, where the grave is the result of the digging. There was no grave until some one dug it, and consequently there was really nothing there to be affected by the action. Examples of this kind of object are We make cakes / They form a circle / He writes a letter / He paints flowers. The other kind, which may be called the repetitive object, really repeats the vb. only, as in She dreamed a dream / He smiled a smile / They fight a good fight. This is very similar, logically, to the conception that Rain rains or Snow snows (although we merely say It snows, It rains in English).

### 12.12. Grammatical Subjects and Objects

It has already been pointed out that the terms “subject” and “object” merely indicate grammatical functions. Further illustrations will make this clear. In “The statue stands (in the yard),” “The mountain stretches (to the north),” “The street turns (to the right),” and “The bridge spans (the river),” “The food agrees (with my stomach),” none of these things, statue, mountain, street, bridge or food, really does anything at all. With abstract nn. this is still clearer: “The question arises,” “School opens,” “The semester begins,” “The problem includes (many factors),” “A lawsuit drags on, or hangs on (for years).” Here the subjects are really incapable of any action.

In the same way, in We hold a meeting, it is hard to see how we can do anything to the object “meeting,” or in Give him a warning or Teach him a lesson, how the warning or the lesson is affected by the man who wants to give or teach it. In take a bath, take a look, take a seat, do we really do anything to “the bath,” “the look” or “the seat”? And in He cut a funny figure, just how was that imaginary thing “figure” affected by the person who “cut” it?

All these show that the relationships indicated by the “subjects” and “objects” are merely grammatical. It is advisable therefore to distinguish between the “doer” of an action and the “subject” of a vb. on the one hand, and on the other, between the “party affected” by the action and the “object” of the vb. The terms “doer” and “party affected” are notional, while the terms “subject” and “object” are grammatical.

(NOTE.—It is considered advisable to avoid the terms “logical subject” and “psychological subject” which mean so many different things with different grammarians. Sometimes these are used to denote the psychologically most important or most prominent word (He is wrong / I am right), sometimes to denote what comes first (They saw him / She married him), sometimes what is already known, with what is less well known as the predicate (He was her brother), sometimes the doer (He was loved by his father), sometimes the word stressed (You can’t deceive me), etc. Used in these senses, a “psychological subject” is merely like a focussed point in a given picture, and it will never be possible to limit that focus to just any one word. Very often the whole sentence forms a unified concept with no central focus or with an even focus, where we should have to admit that the whole sentence is the subject, which would be absurd, grammatically speaking. Such problems belong more properly in the province of logic).

### 12.20. Kinds of Subject

The kinds of subject in the English language are represented by the following examples:—

- (Noun) The garden is in bloom.
- (Verbal N.) Fishing is a pleasant pastime.
- (Pronoun) He was a fool. It is winter.
- (Infinitive) To talk is easy; to act, difficult.
- (Noun Clause) How he did it I can’t understand. Whether he did it or not is none of my business. That this is wrong is admitted. Who breaks pays. Who steals my purse steals trash.

These are the standard types.

Bearing the distinction between grammatical and notional categories in mind, we may discuss a few cases where notionally some subjects are implied which are not so expressed in English. We have the following forms expressing about the same thing:—

- (A) Who believes such a story is a fool.
- (B) He who believes this story is a fool.
- (C) He is a fool to believe this story.
- (D) He is a fool if he believes this story.

Grammatically speaking, in “A,” who believes such a story is the subject; in “B,” he is the subject, with the relative clause who believes this story modifying it; in “C,” he is the subject with the infinitive phrase to believe this story modifying the vb. is; and in “D,” he is again the subject, with the subjunctive clause if he believes this story modifying the vb. is. This is all very correct, because if he did not believe this story, he would not be a fool. The infinitive phrase in “C” and the if-clause in “D” therefore properly modify the vb. is, and not the subject he. But, notionally, don’t they come to the same thing as he who believes this story in “B” where the who-clause modifies the subject he and not the vb. is? And, notionally, is not he who believes this story in “B” as much the subject of is as who believes such a story in “A”? Do not—

Believing this story, he is a fool

and

If he believes this story, he is a fool

really say the same thing? So it is correct to say that, in He is a fool if he believes this story, we really mean he-who-believes-this-story is a fool. Therefore, notionally speaking, he-who-believes-this-story is the subject of the vb. is.

### 12.21. “It” as Subject

(a) In the following sentences, the words in italics indicate the real, though not the grammatical, subject of the vb.—

It is wrong to tell a lie.

It is true that I dislike him.

These mean the same thing as—

To tell a lie is wrong.

That I dislike him is true.

The form with it as the grammatical subject is used because it is much more convenient to dispose of the short predicate first and then state the long subject afterwards. It seems as if we were to say It is wrong and then, in answer to the question “What is it?” say: to tell a lie. To tell a lie is, therefore, said to be “in apposition” to the subject it. In It is true that I dislike him, the subject it may be considered as the “antecedent” of the relative clause that I dislike him. (See § 7.45 for further examples.)

(b) It is also often used without any clear meaning, but merely to satisfy the English grammatical requirement for a subject, as in It rains / It was winter / It is never too late to mend. We really do not know, and do not care to know, what is never too late to mend, or what was winter.

### 12.22. “There is”

The peculiar construction there is corresponds to the Chinese yu (有): There is a boy (=有一小孩). In such sentences, we are forced to assume that the n. following there is is the subject: thus in There is a boy, boy is the subject, and is the vb. Really it does not mean quite the same thing as A boy is there. Phonetically, there in there is, there are is always pronounced without stress or accent: [ðə] ([ðə'rɪz], and [ðə'rɑː] or [ðərə]). This is especially clear in the sentence—

There is a boy there.

The first there is pronounced [ðɛr], while the second there [ðɛə]. The second there serves as a complement to indicate a place, while the first there indicates nothing at all.

(NOTE.—In there’s, the pronunciation is usually [ðɛəz], sometimes [ðɛrz]).

In Let there be light, there sounds suspiciously like a n. (compare Let it be done). However, we are still forced to call it something other than a n., and analyze the sentence as Let light be there. It would be much better to regard there is or there be as a compound vb. deserving to be written as one word and meaning “exist.” Let there be light means “Let light exist,” or “Let light come into being (or existence).”

### 12.30. Transitive Action

A transitive vb. may have an object (I kill—I kill him), but an intransitive vb. cannot (He is sleeping). It has already been mentioned (§ 11.21) that this distinction between vv.t. and vv.i. is also purely grammatical. A transitive action is supposed to pass in, some way or other into its object, while an intransitive action is not: I see the boy, but I slept. Now it is quite clear that in I kill him, the action passes into the object him, but in I see the boy, does the action really pass into the boy? Note also that enter is a v.t. (He enters the room) and that come is an v.i. (He comes into the room), but is there actually any difference between He enters the room and He comes into the room? Therefore it is clear that the difference is not logical, but grammatical. The grammatical difference is that an intransitive vb. requires a prep. to enable it to be connected with any object, while a transitive vb. does not.

### 12.31. Direct and Indirect Objects

A v.t. may have two objects at the same time. In I give you a knife, knife is called the direct object, and you the indirect object. It really means “I give the knife to you.” The person to whom or for whom a thing is done is said to be the indirect object. Thus an indirect object is really an object with a hidden prep. (to or for). According to English idiom, we usually drop the prep., whenever possible, and place the indirect object before the direct object. Buy me a new hat is more idiomatic than Buy a new hat for me. Study the following:—

- Will you do me a favour? (Not: “Will you do a favour for me?”)
- Send him the story. (Not: “Send the story to him.”)
- Wish me good luck. (Not: “Wish good luck to, or for, me.”)
- Pay him the money. (Not: “Pay the money to him.”)
- You do me a great honour. (Not: “You do a great honour to me.”)
- Save me the trouble. (Not: “Save the trouble for me.”)
- Save him some money. (Not: “Save some money for him.”)
- Spare me that agony. (Not: “Spare that agony from me.”)
- Show him the picture. (Not: “Show the picture to him.”)
- Teach him a lesson. Kiss him good-night.
- Give him a warning. Call me a taxi.

The forms in brackets are not ungrammatical, and are sometimes used, but are not really idiomatic. Notice that both forms are used in Chinese: 送我一本書, 給他十塊錢, 報告你一個消息, and 送一本書給我, 拿十塊錢給他, 給你報告一個消息.

With some vbb., we can attach a prep. either to the indirect or to the direct object. We may say I present you with a new book or I present a new book to you / furnish him with information or furnish information to him.

Other vbb. can govern only things and not persons as direct objects: explain a thing, but explain to a person, hence explain that to me, or explain to me something, but never explain me. Still others may govern both persons and things directly, forgive a person and forgive a fault, excuse a person and excuse his appearance. We usually say forgive him his past faults. With vbb. in —ing, we usually say excuse a person from —ing (coming), or forgive a person for —ing (not attending).

**Exercise 99.** The English language is full of idioms like show me, tell me, bring me something, serve me a good dinner, sing me a song, buy me a hat, do a man a good turn, serve him a warning, call me a car, etc. Learn to use these phrases. Translate the following into English:—

1. 給我叫一輛車。
2. 把這事情告訴他。
3. 借我一百元(把一百元借我)。
4. 替我買一枝洋傘。
5. 給他一個警告。
6. 給他一個差事。
7. 衣服給我帶來。
8. 給我做一雙新鞋。

Translate Chinese sentences with the words pa, tui, kei (把, 對, 給) and see how they come out in English. Notice that the use or omission of any prep. and the general arrangement depend entirely on the particular vb. used.

### 12.40. Passive Vbb. with Objects

The conversion of Jack kill Jill into Jill is killed by Jack is quite simple. But when there are two objects, one of them may be converted into a subject in the passive sentence, with the other one still kept. Thus from They told him a lie, we get He was told a lie. Study the following:—

- He was never told the truth.
- He was given a great welcome.
- She was paid three pounds a week.
- We were denied entrance into the park.
- We were given the privilege of going out at night.
- He was shown a picture of deceased.
- When only ten years old, she was taught French and violin.
- When only twelve, she was given a scholarship.

**Exercise 100.** Change the following sentences into passive forms:—

1. They asked him an awkward question.
2. They paid her thirty cents for a day’s work.
3. They allowed her two eggs and one pint of milk per day.
4. They gave him the job as a reward for his services.

### 12.41. Passive Intransitive Vbb

It is of course impossible to form the passive voice with vv.i. which have no objects. If I say She slept there, it is impossible to say that something was slept by her. But vv.i. which are connected with a prep. phrase can be put in the passive voice. If I say No one has slept in this bed, I can change it into the passive by saying that The bed has not been slept in, meaning that the person who used to sleep in it did not come last night.

Now, in §§ 11.20 and 11.21, we have already seen the close connexion between vv.i. and their prepp., as look at, look up, look into, etc. which form very definite concepts. We have also seen that enter (v.t.) the room means the same thing as come (v.i.) into the room. Come into thus forms a definite concept, which is used very much like a v.t. It is therefore easy to understand that we can take the v.i. and its prep. and put them together in the passive voice. Following are some examples:—

- She resents being looked at.
- He is looked upon as a leader.
- The accounts of last year must be looked into.
- A doctor has been sent for.
- The lost watch has been looked for all over the place.
- She is the most talked about girl in town.
- I am done for. (No active form exists)
- He is never listened to.
- That is a thing devoutly to be prayed for.
- That is a question which has been greatly debated about (or upon).
- Who likes to be laughed at?
- From her childhood, she has never been properly looked after.

**Exercise 101.** Convert the above sentences into the active form, using they, we, or no one where no particular doer is mentioned.

### 12.50. Impersonal Subjects

In English, there are a great number of vbb. which can be used with impersonal subjects, very much as we say in Chinese 事情發生, 東西遺失. Unless one takes care to note this use, one might easily make mistakes in the use of vbb. Thus we have: “a dress becomes a person” (looks well on him or her), “food does not agree with a person” (not: person agrees with food), and “idea occurs to a man” (not: man occurs to idea). The proper way to say 我遇見某事 is: “I came across something” or “Something happened to me,” but never “I happened to something.” Study the following examples of vvb. with impersonal subjects:—

- The door opens.
- Shops open at 9.0 a.m. (not are opened)
- The semester begins. (But: Work is begun.)
- Here the letter ends (in speaking of some letter which the speaker has been reading. But: The task is ended).
- Winter begins on Dec. 21 and ends on Mar. 21.
- The disease progresses very slowly.
- The interest gradually accumulates (not is accumulated).
- That doesn't count (=should not be counted).
- It amounts to over a hundred dollars.
- Something (which has been worrying him) weighs upon his mind.
- A picture was hanging (not was hung) on the wall.
- The subject acquires a new interest for me. Also: I acquire a new interest for the subject.
- The problem presses for solution.
- A doubt arises in my mind.
- The fact remains that he did not pay his debt. (Not is remained: a common mistake with Chinese students.)
- How time flies (not is flown)!
- A desire awakened in her breast (not was awakened).
- This knife will last me a life-time (not will be lasted).

It is impossible to draw up any rule as to which kinds of vbb. may take impersonal subjects and which kinds may not. One should merely form the habit of noting whether a certain vb. is used with impersonal subjects or not. The only rule is to consult a dictionary, when in doubt. A certain Chinese student once wrote The men were full of house (for 人滿屋, really The house was full of people), because he had neglected to learn sentences as a whole and to observe the use of an impersonal subject in the case of the phrase be full.

NOTE.—The use of false active (poem reads, book sells) has been discussed in § 11.35. The action of objects (made him come, saw him go) has already been discussed in § 9.91. Reflexive objects have been studied in § 7.23.
