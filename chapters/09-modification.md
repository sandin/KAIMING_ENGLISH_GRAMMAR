## CHAPTER IX: MODIFICATION

### 9.10. Modification: Its Importance

We have mentioned in our discussion on sentence structure (§3.22) that a sentence, no matter how long and complicated, really consists of some of the five parts: (1) subject, (2) principal vb., (3) object, (4) modifiers (including prepositional phrases), and (5) conjunctions. Without the modifiers and conjunctions, we should all be speaking short, bald sentences like these—

Flood came.
Mother died, father disappeared — son sat — door-step — wept.
Student was punished — stole books — proctor saw — dismissed — school — was beaten — father — became robber — became emperor — China.

Thus we should not be able to say where and when the flood came, and whether it was a big flood, a small flood, a terrible flood, or a flood that lasted only three hours—or whether it was a flood of water, or a flood of news, or a flood of tears, or a flood of words. Examine also the following sentence and see what an important part is played by the modifying words, phrases and clauses in italics (phrases and clauses are in brackets):—

(All of a sudden) and (without any warning) the terrible flood came, (a foaming, furious, thundering torrent), (that destroyed houses, streets and whole villages), (drowning men, women, children, cats, dogs and cattle) and (turning the whole region into a lake, dotted here and there with tree-tops and house-roofs with men and women on them like drowned monkeys).

Thus we have—

1. All of a sudden modifying came, or showing how the flood came.
2. Without any warning also showing how.
3. The modifying flood.
4. Terrible also modifying flood.
5. A foaming, furious, thundering torrent, an appositive phrase—showing what kind of a flood it was. The first four words again modify torrent.
6. That destroyed houses, streets and whole villages, a relative clause modifying flood.
7. Drowning men, women, children, cats, dogs and cattle, a participial phrase also modifying flood.
8. Turning the whole region to like drowned monkeys, another participial phrase modifying flood.
    Into a lake further modifies turning.
    Dotted further modifies lake.
    Here and there further modifies dotted.
    With tree-tops and house-roofs modifies dotted.
    With men and women on them modifies house-roofs.
    Like drowned monkeys modifies men and women.

Thus at every step we are tripping on the toes of modifying words and phrases without suspecting them.

Since modification is so common and important, a study of the various means of expressing this will greatly help the student in a fluent mastery of the English language and a better understanding of the structure of English sentences. When modification is understood, there are no other problems about sentence structure, because the subjects, principal vbb., objects and conjunctions are usually easy to find out. We shall study in this chapter, for instance, such common and important constructions as the relative clause, the prepositional phrase, the participial phrase, the infinitive phrase and the complements of principal vbb. which are all some form of modifiers.

### 9.11. Word-Classes and Word-Ranks

In the phrase exceptionally fine music, we say that fine modifies music, and exceptionally modifies fine. Here we feel the n. music to be the principal or chief word, and fine to be only a word used to qualify or modify it; exceptionally, again, is logically subordinate to fine. Hence, it is possible to speak of "word-rank": the modified word seems to stand on a higher rank than its modifier. Similarly, we can distinguish three ranks in the phrases: very (3) entertaining (2) book (1), or quite (3) well (2) written (1), or rapidly (3) rising (2) reputation (1). It will help us to understand the relationships between modifiers and modified, if we use the terms "higher rank," "lower rank" (or "subordinate") and "equal rank" (or "co-ordinate"). Of course, we can have more than three ranks: thus in the following, each added word, except "a," modifies the modifier which stands after it—

an essay
a written essay
a well written essay
a very well written essay
a not very well written essay
a certainly not very well written essay

Word-ranks are different from word-classes or parts of speech. Usually the first modified word is a n., the first modifier is an adj., and the third, fourth and further modifiers are advv. But this is not always the case: thus in the phrase He writes well, the modified word is a vb. write, and not a n., and the first modifier is an adv. well, and not an adj. It is, therefore, necessary to keep the two classes of ideas apart: the terms, "noun," "pronoun," "adjective," "adverb," etc. refer to their word-classes, while the terms "modifier" and "modified" express their word-ranks with reference to one another.* Thus, in the phrase book cover, we may say the n. book is a "modifier" of the n. cover. This is probably clearer than to say that "the n. book is used as an adj." We speak of "modifiers" and "modified" when referring to work-ranks, and speak of 'nouns," "adjectives," etc. when referring to word-classes or parts of speech.

* * *

The following sections (§§9.20-9.27, pp. 207-227) may be partly or entirely omitted at the teacher’s discretion for less advanced classes.

* Jespersen, who first enunciated the theory of "word-ranks," uses the term "primary" for the chief modified word, "adjunct" (or "secondary word") for the first modifier, and "subjunct" (or "tertiary word") for the second modifier. For the sake of simplicity, which is quite a consideration in grammars for students, these words are avoided, and only the terms "modifier" and "modified" are used here.

### 9.20. Relationship between Modified and Modifier

The most common combinations of modifier and modified are either (1) of the written essay type, where we have 1 adj. + 1 n., or (2) of the book cover type, where we have two nn., the first being used to modify the second. The relationship between the modified and the modifier in these two types should be studied, and often there is a question as to which type is the proper one to use. It has already been pointed out in § 2.21 that both Japan tour and Japanese tour (=tour through Japan) may be used; also both college student and collegiate student, and both South China and Southern China. It has further been pointed out that combinations of the second type, like stone wall, honey-bee, motor roads, show different relationships between the modifying word and the modified. A stone wall is a wall made of stone, the honey-bee is the bee producing honey, and a motor road is a road for motor cars.

Now it should be noticed that this second type is very common in modern English. Thus it is very common to find expressions like the geography teacher (地理教員), the China problem (中國問題), the food problem (糧食問題), the Disbandment Conference (編遣會議), maternity hospital (接生醫院) and the fire-brigade (救火隊). One should not say the communicative system for 交通系統, but communication system, nor unemployed situation for 失業狀況, but unemployment situation. Logically speaking, the situation is not unemployed, but there is a situation of unemployment, nor is the system communicative, but really the system of communication is meant. Below are some more examples:—

- air transport 航空運輸
- temperance society 禁酒會
- water problem 飲水問題
- employment bureau 職業介紹所
- arithmetic class 算術課
- railway regulations 鐵道章程
- trade mission 商業調查旅行團
- peace conference 和平會議
- war council 軍事會議
- birthday party 壽宴
- wedding march 結婚進行曲
- swimming suit 游泳衣
- bathing costume 浴裝
- fishing-boat 漁船
- washing-woman 洗衣婦
- printing machine 印刷機
- dancing party 跳舞會
- dining-room 飯廳

It may be noticed here that a bathing costume does not refer to a costume which bathes, but one used for bathing: thus bathing is here originally a vb. turned into a n. and then used as a modifier. Similarly, a fishing-boat is a boat used for fishing purposes. (But a sailing-boat may mean a boat which sails, and a printing machine may mean a machine which prints as well as a boat for sailing and a machine for printing.)

On the other hand, we must notice that the English language has certain phrases which may seem logically wrong, but are idiomatically recognized today. Thus a dead march is the correct expression for a funeral march (cf. wedding march), and a mad-doctor is the correct expression for a doctor of brain diseases (cf. madman, mad dog). These phrases are created for convenience. Again Foreign Office is strictly Foreign Affairs Office or Office of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs (who is also called "Foreign Secretary," but who is really not "foreign" at all). Further examples are:—

- Criminal lawyer, lawyer for criminal cases (刑法律師, 刑名師爺).
- Insolvent court, court to decide cases of insolvency or bankruptcy (處置破產者之法庭).
- Greek student, student of Greek language and literature.
- Indian problem, problem of India.
- English teacher, teacher of English who may be a Chinese.
- Dead list, list of the dead in battle (陣亡表).
- A sickroom, not a sick room, but a room for sick people (病房).
- Female education, education for women (女子敎育).
- Comparative literature, comparative study of the literatures of different peoples (比較文學).
- Clinical thermometer, one for clinical use (醫生驗溫表).
- Married life, life of married men or women (結婚生活).
- Dying wish, wish of a dying man (臨死遺囑).
- Historical novelist, a writer of historical novels.
- Easy money, money that is earned without trouble.
- Difficult friend, friend difficult to get along with.
- Lazy time, time when one is lazy or idle.

It may be noticed that in the case of dead list (=list of the dead), we have an adj. dead used as a n., which is then used as an adj. or modifier again. On the other hand, we have death-duties (=遺產繼承稅, tax levied on property before it goes to the heir of the dead), deathbed (=that on which one dies) and death-rate (=死亡率, the rate of death in a population).

**Exercise 66.** Simplify the following phrases by making them into phrases of the water problem and peace conference type:—

1. A cake like the moon of the Mid-Autumn (中秋月餅).
2. A present for Christmas (聖誕節禮物).
3. A cake for his birthday (壽糕).
4. A gift for the New Year (年禮).
5. His clothes for Sundays (星期日服).
6. Her gown for the night-time (臥服, 寢衣).
7. My studies at school (學堂功課).
8. The days when he was a student (學生時代).
9. The new system of examination (考試制度).
10. The ceremonies for graduation (畢業典禮).
11. A painting of landscape (山水畫).
12. The train leaving at eleven thirty (十一時三十分火車).
13. The railway running between Tientsin and Pukow (津浦鐵路).
14. A reservation for a sleeping berth (臥車定位).
15. A card bearing your name (名片).
16. Your marks in algebra (代數分數).
17. A party in the evening (晚間宴會).
18. During the hours in the morning (早間).
19. Bad discipline in the dormitory (宿舍紀律).
20. Matters concerning money (錢項).
21. Reform of the currency (幣制改革).
22. Bureau for the inspection of lace (花邊檢驗局).

### 9.21. The Use and Omission of Hyphens

From such examples, as fireman, fire-brigade and fire station, one can see that the same logical combination between modifier and modified may be sometimes written as a single word, sometimes as a hyphenated compound, and sometimes as two separate words. In this respect, the English language presents a disgraceful chaos and confusion, and even usage cannot be always depended upon, because different writers and different dictionaries adopt different forms of spelling.* Some people write blackboard, penknife, postgraduate, and others write black-board, pen-knife, post-graduate. Again some people write water-pressure (水壓), wet-nurse (乳母), blood-heat (血溫) (with a hyphen) and others write water pressure, wet nurse, blood heat (without any hyphen). The three stages are also represented by—

(1) football (2) basket-ball (3) volley ball
or (1) bathtub (2) bath-house (3) bath chair (病家所用之掛輪自由椅)

These are spelt differently, although psychologically we feel all three as single words. The utter confusion may be further seen in the following examples:—

- blackmail (1) 勒詐
- blackbird (1) 鳥名
- blackguard (1) 光棍
- black-board (2), also (1)
- black-list (2), also (3) } 注意人
- black book (3), also (2) } 物名簿
- black-head (2), also (1) 粉刺
- black sheep (3) 害羣之馬
- waterproof (1), also (2) 不怕水
- water-tight (2) 不透水
- water-plant (2), also (3) 水草屬
- New Year's Eve (3), also—New-Year's Eve (2)
- headmaster (1), also (2)(3)校長
- footstool (1), also (2) 腳凳
- fruit-knife (2), also (3) 剖果刀
- flag-pole (2), also (1)
- sunlight (1)
- sun-beam (2)
- sun bath (3) 日光浴, 曬日黃
- gunboat (1), also (2)
- gunshot (1), also (2)
- gunpowder (1)
- gun-fire (2), also (1)
- bloodhound (1)
- bloodstone (1) 血玉髓
- blood orange (3) 血紅橘
- blood-heat (2), also (3)
- blood-relation (2), also (3)
- blood brother (3), also (2)
- homecoming (1), also (2)
- fire-irons (2) 火爐用具
- fire-arms (2) 火器
- firefly (1) 螢
- fireplace (1)
- fire-escape (2), also (3) 太平梯
- fire station (3), also (2)
- post office (3), also (2)
- pen-knife (2), also (1)
- bath-tub (2), also (1)

The student should, however, closely observe the usage as far as his reading goes, and should also take some dictionary as his standard, whenever in doubt. He should remember three things. (1) Many words which are written separately are really single words, as full stop, Holy Ghost (聖靈), good will, short story, New Year, fair play (公道), foul play (規犯, 詭計). (2) Most of the hyphenated words have a dominant (or chief) stress on the first words, as pen-knife, hand-bag, class-mate, class-room, day-time ['pen-naif, 'hændbæg, 'klɑ:smeit, 'klɑ:rum, 'deitaim] (which could all be written without hyphens as single words). If the chief stress falls on the second word, there should be generally no hyphen, as good will, short story, New Year, foul play [gud 'wil, ʃɔːt 'stɔːri, njuː 'jɛː, faul 'plei]. (3) The difference between a hyphenated word (gun-cotton, 綿火藥) and a full compound word without hyphen (gunpowder) chiefly depends on age and usage. Generally, the older a word is and the more permanent the compound combination is felt to be, the more likely are we to drop the hyphen: as madman, moonshine, sunlight, sunrise, waterproof, waterfall, rainfall, football, fireplace, but fire-brigade, water-tight, sun-beam, water-melon, basket-ball, side-walk (or sidewalk) and time-table.*

* After admitting the weltering chaos of the English language in this respect, Mr. H. W. Fowler, co-editor of the Concise Oxford Dictionary, believes that, after the lapse of twenty years, he has found a rule which "seems capable of converting the chaos... into something like order.... The simple rule is that in such compounds the legitimacy of hyphenating depends solely on pronunciation: it must only be done if the two parts are said with a single (or with one clearly predominant) stress, and that falls on the first." (See the inserted remarks in the Preface in the 1929 revised edition.) Because headmaster is pronounced with the stress on mas-, and not on head, one should not hyphen it, but should write either headmaster or head master, "either of which will serve." And because water ouzel is pronounced with two equal stresses, there is no choice but to leave the compound as two separate words without hyphen. This rule is psychologically correct and historically justified by the fact of Germanic stress-shifting. It does not alter the fact, however, that until Mr. Fowler's rule is generally followed by the majority of writers and printers, "usage" remains still "a weltering chaos."

### 9.22. Relationship between Modifiers

It has been noticed in § 9.11 that the modifiers and modified stand in different ranks towards one another. E.g.—

- well (3) written (2) essay (1)
- quite (3) well (2) written (1)
- very (3) entertaining (2) book (1)
- quickly (3) rising (2) reputation (1)

In the above examples, the first rank represents the modified, the second rank its modifier, and the third rank the modifier of the modifier. The modifier is supposed to be subordinate to, or of lower rank than, the modified.

Keeping this in mind, we may distinguish the relationship between modifiers as either co-ordinate (of equal rank) or subordinate (lower rank). We have co-ordinate modifiers in good, healthy child (2 + 2 + 1), or pale, thin face (2 + 2 + 1), and one subordinate and one main modifier in rather bitter disappointment (3 + 2 + 1), or thinly concealed lie (3 + 2 + 1).

### 9.23. Co-ordinate Modifiers (2 + 2 + 1)

Let us now first study the co-ordinate modifiers (2 + 2 + 1). The simplest cases are:—

- a small, clear handwriting
- a sweet, graceful manner
- a beautiful, clear voice
- those lonely, bare, stone houses
- a long, eventful career
- that stingy, dirty, little black backyard

Then, in English, we often have conjunctions of various kinds put in between these modifiers. E.g.—

- a rainy and stormy weather
- a careful and efficient worker
- a tedious and long speech
- a small but comfortable room
- a very clever, but rather erratic (unsteady) chap
- a brilliant, but thoroughly impracticable scheme
- a mediocre, but serviceable book of reference
- after a dangerous, though exciting adventure
- a homely but clean-looking face
- a glorious, though defeated fighter
- making slow but sure progress
- progressing slowly but surely

In certain phrases, these modifiers seem to merge with one another in meaning and in a way really modify one another. This is especially clear in phrases beginning with nice and, as nice and clean, nice and cool, nice and warm, nice and soft. Here nice and really acts as a kind of adv. modifier for the following adj. Thus, "The car is going nice and fast" means that it is going fast in a nice way, or satisfactorily fast, and "The house stands nice and high" really means that it stands high enough to satisfy you.* In the same way we have "high and dry talk" (=abstract talk) and "high and mighty manner (=proud, arrogant manner).

These co-ordinate modifiers are often used to reinforce one another's meaning, as in the above example of that stingy, dirty, little black backyard, where it seems the speaker can never condemn it enough, but must pile up more and more adjectives. In such cases, we practically never employ any conjunction, but just pile them up for accumulating effect. Some interesting examples are:—

- I saw a great, big tiger.
- He was a tall, big, husky fellow.
- Don't worry about such small, little things.
- It was only a tiny, little spot.
- That was your great, good luck (not great good luck, but great luck and good luck).
- He had a tremendous, big fortune.
- He had some excellent, good wine.
- It was a terrible, fearful-looking thing.
- You dirty, low-down dog of a scoundrel.
- She had a rich, golden voice.

Finally, we have some very common combinations, where the several modifiers are not truly co-ordinate. If we examine the phrase that nice young lady, we find that this means something rather different from that young nice lady. The second form is usually not used, unless we want to emphasize the word nice. We see, therefore, that young lady forms a concept by itself which is modified by the word nice, and we mean really a nice young lady, and not just a nice lady, nor nice and young lady. The formula for this is really 2 + (2 + 1). Similarly, we say "Take the first fast train" if we emphasize the fast train idea, and "Take the fast first train" if we emphasize the first train idea. It will be noticed, therefore, that the most closely related modifier always stands next to the word modified. Other examples are:—

- your new straw-hat
- a grand wedding party
- every New Year's Day
- his teacher's profession
- his uncle's new book
- her woman's heart
- a big Christmas dinner
- her mother's heart

In the last example, mother's heart forms a concept (=heart of a mother) modified by her. "The loss of the baby broke her mother's heart" means that it broke her motherly heart, and not the heart of the baby's grandmother.

**Exercise 67.** Make sentences or phrases with the following material. Decide which of the following types you wish to use:—

(a) a small, clear handwriting (without conj.)
(b) a tedious and long speech; a clever, but unsteady chap (with conjj. and, or, but, though, although)
(c) that stingy, dirty, little black backyard (piling up modifiers without conj.)

1. Horse—great, Arabic, racing.
2. Car—new, smart-looking, smooth-running, 1929 model.
3. Pen-knife—good-looking, useless.
4. Friend—formerly close, now forgotten.
5. Journey—eventful, miserable, long, three-day, exciting, wonderful, second, etc.
6. House—yellow, red-roofed, foreign-style, cheap-looking, small, moss-grown, ivy-covered, etc.
7. Essay—well-written, clear, not brilliant.
8. Student—so-so, not too good, not too bad.
9. Dress—bright-coloured, silk, new, smart, too thin.

### 9.24. Subordinate Modifiers (3 + 2 + 1)

There are some characteristic combinations of this type which need to be studied. The simplest combination is of course of the type well (3) written (2) essay (1), or much (3) older (2) man (1). The third rank need not always be an adv.; it could be an adj. or a n. Thus—

- English (3) grammar (2) teacher (1)
- ready-made (3) boot (2) shop (1)
- second-hand (3) book (2) store (1)
- newspaper (3) manager’s (2) office (1)

In the case of ready-made boot shop, one should try to avoid confusion by the way of hyphening or joining words. Thus one should avoid such spellings as ready-made boot-shop, and dirty clothes-basket; ready-made boot shop and dirty-clothes basket are preferable.

Study below the characteristic types often found in English:—

**(A) Hyphenated modifiers**

- ready-to-hand proof
- lighter-than-air craft
- four-month-old baby
- three-inch-high heel
- a better-than-nothing substitute

**(B) With adv. + participle**

- the much regretted affair
- the oft-repeated remark
- the ill deserved punishment
- a well-known author
- a well-arranged and admirably carried out plan
- the many-times repeated warning
- some hitherto unpublished letters
- the far-and-wide discussed new product
- an internationally known playwright

**(C) With attached adv. or prepp.**

- unheard-of wonders
- unpaid-for goods
- a dearly paid for mistake
- undreamed-of success
- a much talked-about affair
- the most talked-about girl in Rome
- well-nourished and well brought-up children
- a tightly fastened down mouth
- a long-drawn-out struggle

**(D) With prep. phrases**

- the to me interesting idea
- the for him very ordinary occurrence
- this to her absolutely new experience
- this in many respects inferior work
- a for ever remembered incident

**(E) With infinitive phrases**

- a strongly to be desired reform
- those not to be avoided expenses
- those clearly to be avoided mistakes

We may note here the internal relationships between the modifiers in some typical examples:—

(a) ready(2)-to-hand (3) proof (1), or (2 + 3) + 1.
three-inch(3)-high (2) heel (1), or (3 + 2) + 1.

(b) much (3) regretted (2) affair (1).
far-and-wide (3) discussed (2) new product (2 + 1).

(c) unheard(2)-of (3) wonders (1), or (2 + 3) + 1.
dearly (3) paid for (2 + 3) mistake (1).

(d) to me (3) interesting (2) idea (1).
to her (3) absolutely (3) new (2) experience (1), or 3 + (3 + 2) + 1, or 4 + (3 + 2) + 1.

(e) strongly (3) to be desired (2) reform (1).
not (3) to be avoided (2) expenses (1).

It may be noticed now that the use of hyphens in the above examples is somewhat irregular. Thus we hyphen well-arranged, but not admirably carried out; again, we hyphen long-drawn-out, but not tightly fastened down. This difference, it should be clearly understood, is largely dictated by convenience only; we do not as a rule use any hyphen unless it is necessary or is a help toward clearness. The hyphen serves to show that the whole group of words is used in one grammatical function, thus ready-to-hand is used as one adjective. Like the parenthesis in "(2 + 3) + 1," it serves to bind the group together as a unit. Thus we write "This piano has not yet been paid for," but "this unpaid-for piano." In long combinations, like "admirably carried out plan" or "tightly fastened down mouth," the use of hyphens is felt to be unnecessary and awkward-looking.

**Exercise 68.** Try to make phrases of the "a," "b," "c," "d," "e" types discussed above, by taking those given examples as models and change parts of them. Thus from the following originals, one might make the modifications:—

ORIGINAL                          MODIFICATION
Hitherto unpublished letter...........Hitherto unknown author.
Undreamed-of success..................Undreamed-of fame.
Unpaid-for goods......................Uncared-for children.
The most talked-about girl............The most highly thought-of person.
This for him very ordinary occurrence....This for me very common, etc.

Or complete the following phrases:—

- good-for-nothing ........................ a much talked-about new............
- worse-than-useless ...................... a closely concealed...................
- four-year-old ........................... a closely guarded.....................
- well planned ............................ a much prayed-for....................
- not very well performed ............... a tightly sealed-up..................
- nationally known ......................... a by no means bad...................
- politically unwise....................... a in some respects better............
- to me uninteresting..................... a by far superior.....................
- for him unexpected..................... a soon to be completed...............

### 9.25. Shifted Ranks

In English we often find a shifting of word-ranks in certain phrases. These are mainly of three types: (a) probable winners, from those who probably win, and heavy sleepers from those who sleep heavily; (b) extraordinary good luck for extraordinarily good luck, and real wicked people for really wicked people; and (c) new-laid eggs or newly-laid eggs. Type "a" represents a shifting from (adv. + vb.) to (adj. + n.). Type "b" represents the substitution of adj. in places where adv. would normally be expected. Type "c" contains an adj. or an adv. + a participle.

(a) Adv. + Vb. > Adj. + N. E.g.—

- first offenders
- heavy eaters
- perfect strangers
- quick thinkers
- sound thinkers
- hard students
- close prisoners
- sound sleepers
- good haters
- probable winners
- hard drinkers
- (positive wrong)
- early risers
- swift runners
- (comparative ease)
- long residents
- heavy losers
- (almost certainty)

In all these cases, if we analyze carefully, we see that the modifiers modify only half of the modified words. Heavy eaters does not mean that the eaters are heavy, but that only eating is heavy: they eat heavily. Good haters does not mean the haters are good, but only they can hate very well. Close prisoners are not "close" at all (for that would make no sense), but they are closely guarded. Perfect strangers are far from "perfect," but are only perfectly strange to us. The last three examples in parentheses represent a shifting of ranks not from adv. + vb., but from adv. + adj.—from comparatively easy and positively wrong to comparative ease and positive wrong.

**Exercise 69.** Change the following sentences with a shifting of word-ranks of the italicized words.

1. This fellow does not hear anything when he is asleep. He sleeps soundly.
2. Don't punish him too hard. This is the first time he ever commits an offence.
3. Among you three, Chu-lien is going to lose most heavily in this deal.
4. He writes quickly. He writes rapidly.
5. He came here only a short while ago. (New-comer.)
6. He has been in this country a long time. (Old-timer.)
7. This man talks glibly.
8. That man can be easily victimized or cheated.

(b) Adj. + Adj. There is a steady tendency in the English language to cut out the adv. ending -ly in places where briefness and force are wanted for effect, especially in colloquial speech. Thus Come quick is now more common than Come quickly, because the adding of the -ly seems to decrease the force of the word. One might say He is devilishly handsome, and She is deucedly clever, but it is more idiomatic to say devilish handsome and deuced clever. Similarly, extraordinary good luck and real wicked people are more expressive than extraordinarily good and really wicked. So also, we have the -ly regularly dropped in dead, hard and fast as adv., as dead drunk, dead pale, dead tired, hard hit, hard pressed, run fast. Notice that in the following examples, it is always adj. expressing emphasis or intensity that are subject to this strange shifting of duty, which proves that the desire for brevity and force is the cause of this apparent shifting. Those examples not quite accepted in literary English are marked with an asterisk.*

(A) burning hot soup
- *mighty glad
- bitter cold
- shocking bad novel
- *jolly nice
- biting cold
- real wicked guy
- *jolly good
- blazing hot
- excellent good friends
- devilish handsome
- real stubborn fellow
- deuced clever
- extraordinary good luck
- confounded difficult
- (C) red-hot
- *wondrous fine
- snowy-white
- ashy-pale
- bitter-sweet
- dark red
- deep blue
- light green
- wide open

(B) *exceeding small
- *exceeding hot
- *thundering good
- passing strange
- *uncommon fine
- *terrible strong
- dead tired
- dead drunk
- dead asleep
- stark naked

One notices that the examples under "A" could easily be explained as having a real adj. in the first modifier. Thus shocking bad novel may mean a novel both bad and shocking, as well as shockingly bad. but real stubborn fellow must be explained as real stubborn-fellow, and excellent good friends must be explained as excellent good-friends. Good friends, good luck, stubborn fellow thus form single concepts modified by the adj. The cases under "C" are really felt as compound modifiers, consisting of two adj. Thus red modifies hot, snowy modifies white, and ashy modifies pale, but at the same time we feel that red also directly modifies the hot object, which looks red, and snowy also directly modifies the white substance. In the same way a window which is described as wide open is not only widely open, but is also wide because it is open: wide, therefore, directly modifies the window as well as open. A "bitter-sweet experience" is an experience that is both sweet and bitter; it is therefore different from a "bitter cold night" which means a night bitterly cold. Dark red, deep blue and light green are felt as compound adj.

(c) Adj. or Adv. + Participle.

- new-laid eggs, or newly laid eggs
- new-born baby, or newly born baby
- new-coined words, or newly coined words
- newly-married couples
- green-painted houses, but thoroughly re-painted car
- smoky-looking walls
- good-mannered people, or well-mannered people
- moderate-sized building, or moderately sized building
- foreign-built house
- deep dug-in trenches
- plain-spoken man

Just as in the case of red-hot iron, we retain the adj. form red because it partly modifies iron itself, so also in the case of new-laid eggs, it is possible to say new, because we are partly thinking of new eggs. In these cases, we can say new when we feel that it modifies eggs, and say newly when we intend it to modify the participle laid. Hence we can have moderate-sized houses or moderately sized houses, but must say green painted and not greenly painted. Foreign-built houses does not mean that they are built by foreigners or in foreign countries, but that the houses themselves are in foreign style. These cases will be made clearer from a study of the following paragraph.

* For the source of most of the examples given, see Modern English Grammar, II, 15.2.

### 9.26. Transformed Phrases as Modifiers

In the above examples, good-mannered man and well mannered man, moderate-sized building and moderately sized building, we have really two types of modifiers. The type well mannered man and moderately sized building is easy to understand or analyze. The other type really belongs to a large class of modifiers which are quite freely formed in English. These may really be regarded as phrases transformed into modifiers for the sake of convenience and brevity. Thus—

A moderate-sized building = a building of moderate size.
A good-mannered man = a man of good manners.

The concepts moderate-size and good-manners are taken as a whole, given an -ed, and used as modifiers.

Two most important and useful types of such modifiers transformed from phrases are worth studying:—

**"Adj. + N. + -ed"**

- moderate-sized house
- good-mannered man
- good-hearted people
- seven-hilled city
- three-legged cat (三脚貓)
- eight-legged essay (八股文)
- nine-headed bird (九頭鳥)
- bob-haired girl
- red-haired woman
- smooth-tongued fellow
- three-storied building
- round-eyed innocent
- chicken-hearted fellow
- clean-minded man
- able-bodied men
- evil-minded man
- swell-headed fellow
- bow-legged child

**"X + Vb. + -ing, or -ed"**

(a) hair-raising stunts
- blood-curdling story
- heart-rending problem
- flesh-eating animal
- awe-inspiring appearance
- body-building food
- story-telling contest
- self-starting machine
- peace-loving people

(b) frost-bitten flowers
- thunder-struck face
- famine-stricken district
- God-forsaken sinner
- storm-tossed ship

(c) smoky-looking room
- cheap-looking dress
- deep-sunken well
- slow-going boat
- high-sounding speech

It is quite clear that in both cases, both of the hyphenated members are taken as a whole to modify the following word. Thus nine-headed bird really means nine-headed bird (=a bird with nine heads) and not nine headed-birds. Headed-bird would make just as little sense as raising stunts or curdling story. In the second group formed with vbb., we have under (a) vbb. + their objects, (b) vbb. + their logical subjects, and (c) vbb. with complements.

(a) hair-raising stunts = stunts that raise your hair.
(b) frost-bitten flowers = flowers bitten by frost.
(c) smoky-looking room = a room that looks smoky.

Because the room looks smoky, and the well is sunken deep (smoky modifying room, and deep modifying well), we do not say "smokily-looking room" or "deeply sunken well."

**Exercise 70.** (A) Try to turn all the above phrase-modifiers into phrases or clauses following the modified words.

(B) Transform the following phrases or clauses into phrase-modifiers preceding the modified words:—

1. A crook with a double face.
2. A chair with three legs.
3. A house with five rooms.
4. A boy with a round face.
5. My brother who uses his left hand more than his right hand.
6. The quinine pills coated with sugar.
7. Cigarettes with cork tips.
8. Sticks with golden handles.
9. A man with a cool head.
10. A young man with a hot head.
11. That child who looks sleepy.
12. A machine for cutting paper.
13. A machine for rolling cigarettes.
14. A device for saving money.
15. A policy that shares the profits of the company.
16. A man who is educated by himself.
17. A people abiding by the law.
18. A person who means well.
19. A wall which is painted dark.
20. Old age which is approaching fast.
21. The habit of telling the truth.
22. A country torn by war.
23. A nation that drinks tea.
24. People who go to church.
25. Shoes made by hand, or made by machine.

### 9.27. Nouns and Verbs as Modifiers

Nn. and vbb. are usually words modified by others. It is not so uncommon, however, to find nn. and vbb. acting as modifiers themselves. Examples of nn. as modifiers are:—

- I kind of admire him (admire him in a way).
- I was a sort of tired and disgusted with the whole business.
- I sort of pitied him.
- He was way above the others.
- He was standing miles off from the place.
- The husband and wife are a world apart as human beings.
- Edison says that Henry Ford is sometimes happy, but he is never happy a billion dollars' worth.
- This cloth is thirty-six inches wide.
- I don't care a twopence what you do with it.
- I don't care a rap (a bit) about it.
- A child may say to her mother, "I love my sister a little bit, and love you a whole big balloon."
- This is twenty-five cents above the usual price.
- He was three times older than his "uncle."
- I am coming next week.
- I am going this Thursday.
- That was something awful, something great (here used in the sense of "indeed awful," etc.).
- The picture was nothing wrong (meaning not at all wrong; in some constructions, we find even nothing plus a participle, as "nothing daunted," meaning not at all daunted).
- Go one better (American slang=go one step or one degree further).
- You haven't the ghost of a chance (=a ghostly chance).
- He had a hell of a time (=hellish time).
- That rascal of a fellow (=rascally fellow).
- That shiftless, sin-smelling drunkard of a husband (=husband who is a drunkard).
- You will catch a death of a cold (=a deadly cold).

It will be seen that in the last five examples, the first n. really modifies the second n. and is thus its logical modifier, although grammatically the second n. seems to modify the first. Thus in hell of a time, logically hell modifies time, while grammatically of a time modifies hell.

Vbb., because of their very nature, are very seldom used as modifiers. This is because, when they are used as modifiers, they generally take the form of a participle or an infinitive phrase, and these will be studied in the following sections. When they are not participles or infinitives, they generally have a subject expressed or understood, and this makes it difficult for them to act as modifiers. There are, however, some cases where an independent clause with a finite vb. has become amalgamated into adv., as in the following:—

- Maybe you are mistaken; maybe I can do it (from independent clause it may be, meaning perhaps).
- I will go away temporarily, say (from let us say), for three weeks, and then come back.
- Bring him in here, willy-nilly (from will he, nill he=whether he likes it or not).

The words please and suppose retain still clearly the force of an imperative vb. in Please ring the bell and Suppose he won't consent, but are coming dangerously near to being advv. in—

- Will you please do that? (Cf. "Will you kindly do that?")
- Suppose we go to bed. (in imperative, as a formula of proposal)

Also, there are sound-descriptive words, like pop, crash, bang, which are somewhat different from usual vbb. in character, but which are both used as vbb. and as advv.

[As vb.] Pop the question (=propose marriage) / pop in and out (=go or put suddenly) / pop the pistol.
[As adv.] Pop goes the weasel (name of a country dance) / Something inside there goes pop (=breaks with a pop).

[As vb.] Bang the door / Doors bang.
[As adv.] Hit him bang in the face / He fell bang on the floor.

[As vb.] Crash through the gate / The whole building crashed down.
[As adv.] A piece of stone came crash through the window.

It may also be noticed that the word let in let alone (=not to speak of) is often used in a place where a participle or an infinitive would seem to be required:—

He cannot unify his own province, let alone unifying the whole country (really we will let alone the question of, etc.)

### 9.30. Phrase and Clause Modifiers

So far, we have been considering modifiers that precede the words they modify, together with the relationship between such word-modifiers. Now, we shall study modifiers that follow the words they modify and these are principally phrases and clauses. These are the Infinitive Phrase, the Participial Phrase, the Prepositional Phrase, and the Relative Clause and their modifications. Finally, we shall go on to study the Predicate Modifiers, which are generally words again, and not phrases or clauses. This will conclude our study of the important function of modification.

### 9.31. The Infinitive Phrase as Modifier

The infinitive is one of the commonest forms used in English. We have already seen it used as a noun phrase in § 2.30. Here we shall study its function as a modifier. The main types are five:—

(a) Something to do, a book to read (as adj.).
(b) Came to tell you, began to see (to complete the meaning of some preceding vb.).
(c) Brave enough to go, too poor to pay (to complete the meaning of some preceding adj.).
(d) To be sure, to tell you the truth (as an independent or absolute phrase in a sentence).
(e) Ask him to come, allow him to stay (modifying the object).

The types "b" and "e" are strictly both predicate modifiers, but for the sake of convenience, "b" will be studied here first, while "e" will come under §9.70.

Examples for study and practice follow:—

(a) These include the English equivalents of Chinese phrases like 有事可做, 無書可讀, 有人做伴, 有功課要預備, etc.

- Something to do, to see, to talk about, to read.
- Nothing to do, to see, to eat, to drink.
- Nobody to play with, to talk to, to appreciate.
- Somebody to encourage you, to keep you company, to understand your troubles, to be your friend and adviser, to lend you money.
- You have everything to gain and nothing to lose by going to see him.
- I have a story to tell you.
- No money to spend
- A lesson to prepare.
- A family to feed.
- A lesson to copy.
- A brother to educate.
- Some work to do.
- A question to ask.
- A new world to conquer.
- A request to make.
- A desire to learn.
- Ability to talk.
- No desire to study.
- Mind to study.
- No chance to see him.
- Power to give.
- Readiness to act.
- Permission to go.
- Money to buy.
- Will to try.
- No time to wait.
- Opportunity to see.

**Exercise 71.** Translate these into Chinese and then back into English again. This may be done by yourself in the form of writing, or with the help of the teacher or some other students giving the Chinese equivalents. Then make sentences with these material, or form new phrases with the following as the words to be modified: no chance, no time, no opportunity, ability, desire, nothing, something.

(b) When we say try to see him, the infinitive phrase to see him obviously helps to complete the meaning of the principal vb. try. Inasmuch as the infinitive here completes the meaning of the principal vb., it may be called a complement of that vb. As it comes directly within the predicate itself and modifies the principal vb., it may be also called a predicate modifier of the vb. The English language abounds with such idiomatic expressions, and they include not only vbb. in the active voice, but also vbb. in the passive voice and adjj.

(Vb.) Begin to.................... (Pass.) Be pleased to....................
Continue to.................... Be told to....................
Cease to.................... Be surprised to....................
Help to.................... Be disappointed to....................
Seem to.................... Be interested to....................
Hope to.................... Be allowed to....................
Wish to.................... Is said to....................
Neglect to.................... Is believed to....................
Forgot to.................... Is understood to....................
Remember to.................... Is supposed to....................
Intend to.................... Is considered to....................
Plan to.................... Is requested to....................
Want to.................... Is destined to....................
Care to.................... Is prepared to....................
Dare to.................... (Adj.) Be careful to....................
Decide to.................... Be foolish to....................
Determine to.................... Be crazy to....................
Offer to.................... Be afraid to....................
Have come to.................... Be quick to understand.
Propose to.................... Be slow to act.
Prepare to.................... Be anxious to....................
Hasten to.................... Be desirous to....................

**Exercise 72.** Try to expand these into complete sentences orally, and see if you can add new ones to the list.

(c) With adj. like enough, sufficient and adv. like too, enough, so, the meaning is left incomplete without the infinitive phrase following them.

- He is too proud to learn.
- Be good enough to tell me.
- He is too lazy to study.
- Be so kind as to tell me.
- There was enough opium in the consignment to poison the whole city population of Shanghai.
- This is too good to be true.
- This happiness is too great to last.
- We have sufficient money (or money sufficient) to last us a week.
- He was fool enough to tell him everything.
- He is not man enough to confess his mistake.
- The colours of the dress are too loud to be in accordance with good taste.
- It is never too late to mend.
- He came too late to see the opening of the show.
- I am now old enough to see the truth of it.
- He is old enough to be your father.

**Exercise 73.** Complete the following sentences:—

- The child is big enough to...............
- He was not brave enough to...............
- The insult was too deep to...............
- The composition was too long to...............
- I have not time enough to...............
- People are so foolish as to...............
- China is too big to...............

(d) Finally, we have infinitive phrases inserted in the middle of a sentence to modify the meaning of the whole statement. Examples are:—

- To begin with, you started the quarrel.
- To make a long story short, he was arrested and put in prison.
- To tell you the truth, I don't want to marry her.
- This, to be sure, is not your fault.
- To be perfectly frank with you, you can be a successful barber.
- Strange to say, we met again at Chefoo.
- And after the husband died, the concubine acted like the lord of the family and husband of the wife, so to speak.

**Exercise 74.** Make sentences expressing the meaning contained in Chinese absolute phrases like: 說也奇怪, 老實說, 老實對你講, 總括一句.

### 9.32. The Split Infinitive, etc.

As can be seen from the above examples, the vb. in the infinitive can take on modifiers and objects like other vbb. E.g.—

To tell you the truth (you indirect object, and truth direct object).
To last us one week (one week adv. phrase of time, modifying last).

The infinitive can be in the active or passive voice, and can be in the perfect or imperfect tense:—

- Active. A house to let. (Owner has house to let.)
- Passive. A house to be let. (House is to be let.)
- Perfect. He seems to have read a great many books.
- Imperfect. He seems to be working all the time.

Now, with regard to the modifiers of the infinitive, when we put a modifier between to and the vb., we have what is usually called a split infinitive.

- To come quickly. (Normal.)
- To quickly come. (Split Infinitive.)

There are many "non-splitters" among the grammarians who absolutely will not countenance a split infinitive, like to quickly come. But there are just as many people, and among them good writers, who take care to consciously and deliberately flaunt the rule. The plain truth is, however, that the only determining factors should be: clearness of meaning and the natural rhythm of the language. Usually, a split infinitive breaks the natural rhythm of the sentence, as in—

Tell him to quickly come ↘

But—

Tell him quickly to come.

is just as bad, because the rhythm is not better, and the meaning is not clear (ambiguous): quickly may as well be taken to modify tell as to modify come. The only clear and natural way is to say—

Tell him to come quickly.

Study also the following alternatives:—

(1) He has begun to really understand it.
(2) He has begun really to understand it.
(3) He has begun to understand it really.

Form "1" is best, because it is clearest and most natural. Form "2" is natural, but slightly ambiguous; while form "3" puts too much emphasis on really by giving it the final position.

The fact is, all advv. have their normal or natural positions, and any attempt to remove them to a new position either spoils the natural rhythm of the sentence, or tends to give the advv. an undue emphasis.

**Exercise 75.** Decide where the advv. (in italics) are to be placed in the following sentences, and find out your own reason for doing so.

1. We need / to further strengthen / our position /.
2. His army seemed completely to / have been / destroyed /.
3. The principles will have boldly to / be / followed /.
4. The letter ought carefully to / be / written /.
5. He was able immediately to / perceive / the importance of the suggestion.
6. His action seemed largely to / have been / dictated / by selfish motives /.
7. To / stop effectively and permanently wars in China /, we must wait for another Ice Age, since Chinese civil wars always stop in winter.
8. Such mistakes are absolutely to / be / avoided /.

### 9.33. Need to, Dare to

We know that words like can, will, may, must, shall (called auxiliaries, or helping vbb.) are followed directly by vbb. in the infinitive with the to omitted, e.g., can go, will go, must go, etc There are two vbb. in the English language which are becoming auxiliaries, but which have not developed so far as the other words. That is to say, they are used exactly like must, can, etc. in questions and negative sentences, but not in affirmative sentences:—

- Need                   Dare                  (Can, etc.)
- Quest. Need he go?     Dare he go?           (Can he go?)
- Neg.   He need not go. He dare not go.        (He cannot go.)
- Aff.   He needs to go. He dares to go.        (He can go.)

In the affirmative sentence, we add an -s in the 3rd person sing., and we do not omit the to. Besides Dare he go? / Need he go? we can also say Does he dare to go? / Does he need to go? And besides He dare not go / He need not go, we can say He does not need to go / He does not dare to go.

Notice, however, that to is usually omitted in the following negative sentences, even though the phrase dare not or need not does not directly occur:—

- No one need know about it.
- No one dare say a word about it.
- You need tell no one.
- Under no circumstances dare he betray the secret.
- I need hardly tell you that . . . . (hardly=almost not)

The word please sometimes drops, and sometimes retains, the to behind it:—

- Please ring the bell.
- Please to ring the bell.
- Please don't (or do not) forget.
- Please not to forget.

The words make, bid, etc. will be treated under § 9.91.

**Exercise 76.** Transform the following orally into negative sentences and questions, either with do or without do, over and over again until you can do it quickly without mistake.

1. You dare to go alone.
2. They dare to tell me that.
3. You need to be so careful.
4. We needed to show him everything.
5. We need to come too.
6. He needs to be reminded of it.

(NOTE.—The above sentences are formed for practice only, and are not quite idiomatic. In affirmative sentences, dare to is used, but always stressed, while need to is seldom used, its idiomatic form being have to (须) and not need to. Need in the affirmative is usually used in constructions like need something, he needs a book, a pen, etc.)

### 9.40. The Participial Phrase as Modifier

The participial phrase is one of the commonest constructions in English, and yet many Chinese students have learnt its name without knowing how to use it in sentences. The reason is that they have not learnt to distinguish between vbb. expressing an action and vbb. expressing a state or condition. This is best illustrated in the sentence: 我站在那兒等着他 (I stood there, waiting for him) and its variations. It will be seen in the following that the Chinese particle cho (着) serves the same purpose as the ending -ing in participles to indicate a condition:—

- 我站在那兒等着他。 I stood there, waiting for him.
- 我站着等他。 I waited there standing.
- 我坐着等他。 I waited there sitting.

The vb. without -ing is the principal vb. and the vb. in -ing (participle) is meant only to help describe a condition. The participial phrase is therefore subordinate in relation to the main clause, serving as a modifier only. One should learn to subordinate the vb. describing a condition and put it into the participial form. One could say "I stood and waited," but it would be better English to say "I stood waiting there"; if it is intended to describe the standing as a condition, one should say, "I waited there, standing (in the rain)." The most common uses of the participial phrase are to describe a manner, a cause or motive, and to indicate general relationships.

(1) Describing manner.—

- Making three circles with his chop-sticks, he invited his guests to help themselves.
- Paying no attention to what the others said, he went ahead.
- Brushing everybody aside, he pushed his way into the mob and kissed the drowned girl.
- Shouting at the top of his voice, he said to them . . . .
- The child returned home, stretching both his hands to his mamma, and dropping his satchel.
- The old man came, mumbling something in an undertone.

(2) Describing cause or motive.—The words think, believe, mistake, hear, etc., when used as participles, usually describe a state of mind, and therefore help to indicate or explain the motive of action.—

- Knowing that the child's case was hopeless, he did not consult the doctor but the priest.
- Seeing that there was no more hope, the parents sat quietly in despair.
- Thinking that Chinese medicine might help, they sent for an old Chinese doctor.
- Believing what the Chinese doctor said, they had high hopes again.
- I left Shanghai last Monday, intending to spend a month in Japan (or: intending never to come back).
- Frightened by the news, he came back.
- Failing to carry out his plan, he bought a steamship ticket and sailed for Australia.
- Coming from an old French stock, he had his ordinary share of pride in the mother country.

(3) Indicating general relationships.—Participial phrases used for this purpose generally stand at the beginning of a sentence, as this helps to make the general relationship of the sentence clearer.

- Coming back to our first topic, I may say ....
- Speaking of Chinese art, there are many things waiting to be written about it.
- Writing in the Fourteenth Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, he pointed out ....
- Having made this point clear, I may go on to ....

In this connexion, it may be mentioned that the participles concerning and regarding, originally belonging to this class and serving this purpose, are now generally regarded as prepp. Granting, providing and granted, provided are used indifferently as conjj.—

- Regarding your note of the 14th, I beg to inform you that ....
- Concerning the plan for the new school building, it has been proposed that ....
- Granting (or Granted) that he didn't know, he should have written to inquire about it.
- will go, provided (or providing) you send a car.

Concerning the difference between present and past participles, see §2.33.

**Exercise 77.** (A) Form sentences with the following participles describing manner, cause, or motive:—

- hearing that
- leaving a letter
- seeing that
- planning to
- mistaking the noise
- advancing three steps
- wishing to
- waving his hand
- kneeling on the ground
- encouraged by
- lying on his face
- surprised by
- desiring to
- drenched through with rain
- having finished his work
- supported by
- determined to
- exhausted through work
- frightened by
- having been told that

(B) Learn to subordinate some of the vbb., turning them into descriptive participles:—

1. We sat and talked and forgot that the messenger had been waiting outside all the while.
2. He disappeared early in the morning and left no trace of himself.
3. He came home at last, and believed that his fiancée was still living.
4. Correct these sentences and change the vbb. if they are wrong.
5. He sat and waited there and read a book.
6. He turned to me and asked me a hard question.
7. He asked the question and pointed his finger at me.
8. He was supported by thirty young students and rushed on to the stage.

(C) Translate the following into English, using participles for the underlined words:—

1. 婦婦回來，手裏提着一籃的菜。
2. 她還是不肯再嫁，希望她的前夫一旦能夠回轉念頭。
3. 他昨夜還預備功課，以爲(誤認)今天為星期一。
4. 他坐在案前，用一枝紅鉛筆改作文。
5. 他知道(或聽見)今天我拿到薪水，又來向我借錢。
6. 他們倆一夜不睡，一直談到天亮。
7. 他答應了，說事做完就來。

### 9.41. Misconnected Participles

Great care should be taken with regard to the word (n. or pron.) to be modified by the participle. The participle introducing a participial phrase ought to modify the subject of the main clause, to which the participial phrase is attached. Thus, in—

Having finished my lesson, I went home.

the participle having finished modifies the subject of the main clause, I. It is, however, very easy to connect it up with a subject which it logically cannot modify. One might easily say:

Having finished my lesson, the teacher let me go home first.

This is wrong because it was not the teacher who had finished the lesson. One ought to say, therefore—

Having finished my lesson, I was allowed by the teacher to go home first.

**Exercise 78.** Study the following examples, and see why the participles are wrongly connected. When it is difficult to make the correct participial construction, other forms may be used, e.g., "As I have finished my lesson," or "When he was three years old."

1. Being three years old, his father died.
2. Not knowing the strange town, the guide showed me the different places worth visiting.
3. Having punished them enough already, cannot the prisoners be set free now?
4. Being desirous to settle the accounts, will you please send me the amount due by return post?
5. Being a movie fan, Colman and Barrymore are his favourites.
6. Being a despotic ruler, the people disliked him.

### 9.42. Absolute Participial Phrase

A participial phrase, as we have seen, always begins with a participle which modifies the subject of the main clause. It is thus dependent on the main clause. We may have, however, a participial phrase containing its own subject, as follows—

He being a despotic ruler, the people disliked him.
Mr. Watson being too weak to attend the meeting, I went in his stead.

Such constructions are called absolute participial phrases, by which we mean that the participle is not directly connected with the subject of the main clause, although the phrase itself is still in a subordinate relation to the latter. Further examples are—

- Weather permitting, we shall go for a picnic on Monday.
- God willing, I shall take care of your mother till the end of her days.
- All things considered, he was the best boy in class.
- There were a hundred seventy-two of them, all told.
- There were a hundred seventy-two of them, the spoilt ones excepted.
- You had better all go back, Pan taking up his old work and you continuing yours.
- I paid for my friend, he happening to be out of pocket.
- Then we went over the top, the captain leading the attack himself.
- The accused being under sixteen years of age, we should not send him to prison, but to the reformatory.
- There being no evidence against him, and he denying the charge, we could do nothing.
- Your last check being dishonoured by the bank, I shall have to ask you for another one.
- I should not advise you to go to Hangchow now, this being the rainy season of the year.

Notice that in most of these examples, other longer expressions might be substituted, e.g., "if weather permits," "if you take everything into consideration."

It should be noted, however, that in the case of participles expressing general relationships (see "3" above), the participial phrase really modifies the general intent of the whole sentence, and not the subject of the main clause only. Hence, the following examples are correct:—

- (Talking of the football match), who won?
- (Granting that B— College was defeated), were their men to blame?
- (Granting his honesty), he may be mistaken in his enthusiasm.
- (Allowing for minor deficiencies), the play was on the whole a success.
- (Coming to the question of the proper marrying age), did not my father marry at twenty-nine?
- There are thirteen left, (not counting the spoilt ones).

In all the above examples, it will be seen that the participial phrase modifies the main statement as a whole.

### 9.50. The Prepositional Phrase

Of all the kinds of phrases in English, the prepositional phrase is by far the most commonly used. Some examples will suffice to show that a great number of the commonest phrases are of this class.

- at first
- at the meeting
- by chance (偶然)
- at last
- at Shanghai
- by luck (碰巧)
- at least
- at great cost
- on purpose (故意)
- at once
- at me, you, him, etc.
- after all (到底)
- at the same time
- with me, you, him, it, etc.
- in case (倘若)
- at the beginning
- by her, him, it, etc.
- by turn (輪流)
- at the end
- through us, you, them, etc.
- in fact (其實)
- at this price
- for her, you, me, etc.
- in time (及時)
- at this time
- (cook) by gas, electricity, etc.
- for example (例如)
- at this place
- (go) by train, boat, etc.
- above all (首先)

This is also easily seen from the fact that prepositions, like in, at, on, for, to, down, up, before, after, by, through, with, without, against, etc. are among the commonest words in English, and that every time a preposition is used, it forms a prepositional phrase (see § 2.11 "6"). Besides the above, one should also take account of the following extremely common compound prepositions:—

- as to, as for
- in view of
- for fear of
- on account of
- in case of
- with reference to
- instead of
- in connexion with
- with (in) regard to
- in spite of
- by means of
- in accordance with
- in place of
- by way of
- on behalf of

For further examples of the uses of prepositions, see § 2.18, Exercise 5.

**Exercise 79.** Make sentences with the prepositions and prepositional phrases mentioned above.

### 9.51. Prepositions for Brevity

Compare the following sentences:—

(a) He died of malaria.
     He died because he had malaria.
(b) He was convicted of murder.
     He was convicted as a man who had committed murder.

It will be seen at once that the great advantage in using prepositional phrases is that they make the sentences shorter and therefore neater.

**Exercise 80.** Make the following sentences shorter by using prepositional phrases in place of the clauses in italics. Use nn. or vbb. in -ing after the prepp. suggested in brackets.

1. There was a row when they were holding the meeting. (at, during)
2. The student was punished because he came late. (for)
3. He could not climb the mountain because he had heart trouble. (on account of)
4. Some work in order to be wealthy and some in order to become famous. (for)
5. The big Swedish concern collapsed when Krueger died. (at)
6. He went all the same, although I advised him not to. (in spite of)
7. He went away and did not say a word. (without)
8. He returned home, taking a train. (by)
9. I could not come because I was ill. (on account of)
10. As Reuter has reported, the Japanese have seized the customs revenue at Dairen. (according to)

### 9.52. Prepositions at End

In idiomatic and colloquial English, as distinguished from pedantic writing, the prepositions are very often left at the end of a sentence or clause. "He is the man you are looking for" is more idiomatic than "He is the man for whom you are looking." This is because, in English, the prepositions form with their preceding verbs or adj. definite phrases with a very definite meaning, like look for. In spite of what many grammarians say, a truly natural and idiomatic English style cannot get along without often allowing prepositions to stand at the end of sentences or clauses. The following examples of extremely common and idiomatic sentences will suffice to show this English tendency.

- What are you doing that for?
- What are you looking at?
- That will give you something to think about.
- You can never tell what this will lead to.
- Do you think he is a man you can depend on?
- People in famine districts will eat anything they can lay their hands on. ("Anything on which they can lay their hands" would sound pedantic here.)
- That depends on what they are cut with. (Not "That depends on with what they are cut")
- The Government did something you would never dream of.
- Do you know who you are speaking to? (To say "Do you know to whom you are speaking" would lose the whole force of the question.)

Note that in order to avoid leaving prepositions at the end in the above sentences, phrases like for whom, with which, about which will have to be used, and these constructions are always awkward and roundabout.

### 9.53. But, Than

"But" and "than" are sometimes used, even by good writers, as prepositions followed by pron. in the objective case, as follows:—

- All but me had fled.
- No one wishes it more than us.

Now both these words may be used as conjj., and therefore but I and than we could also be used. As a rule, one should generally avoid using the objective case, where but and than could be used as conjj. with pron. in the nominative case. In modern English, the only surely correct usage of than as prep. with a pron. in the objective case following is in the phrase than whom, as in—

The occasion called for a man of great wisdom and courage like Mr. R—, than whom no one could suggest a better candidate for the presidency.

As a conj., than may have a nominative or objective pron. following, according to the circumstances. In the sentence, "They treated him worse than her," the meaning is "worse than they treated her." On the other hand, "They treated him worse than she" would mean "worse than she treated him."

### 9.54. Some Special Uses of English Prepositions

A few peculiar uses of some prepositions may be noted here. The use of a preposition in any particular place is purely determined by custom and usage, and different languages often use different prepositions to express the same meaning (see § 6.61). Following are some special uses of English prepp. worth noting:—

**With, for descriptive phrases.**

- He came home a disappointed man, with his business ruined, his money gone, his health broken and his self-confidence visibly shaken.
- With one of his legs gone, he was still able to go about visiting his friends.
- I saw a woman walking in the street, with a baby in her breast and another child holding her hand.

**With or for + all, meaning "in spite of."**

- With all his experience and technical training, he could not build that bridge a one.
- For all his thrift and care in spending money, he still remains a poor man.
- For all his charity, Rockefeller took more from others than he has ever given back to the world.
- Mr. F— may be the owner of this property, for all I know (here in a slightly different sense="as far as I know").

**Under, denoting an incomplete process.**

- The bridge under construction; the question under consideration; the patient under treatment; the project under consideration.

**To, expressing effect on a person's mind.**

- To my great surprise, he turned up at the last moment.
- He failed to turn up, to our great disappointment.
- We found, to our great delight, that the news wasn't true.

**In, describing some part or detail affected.**

- He was blind in the eye; injured in the knee.
- Chang is weak in algebra.

**On, meaning "immediately after" or "as the result of."**

- On arriving at the scene, I found . . .
- On examination, I found . . .
- On second thought, I decided to change the subject.
- On hearing the news, I went to see the manager.

**On, suggesting a temporary state.**

- On the move; on fire; on strike; on leave; on his best behaviour; on good terms with.

**Through, meaning "by" but suggesting effort.**

- He obtained the job through my influence (help).
- It was through (because of) you that we failed.
- That was all done through (because of) jealousy (ignorance, carelessness, etc.).

**Exercise 81.** Make sentences showing the use of the prepositions mentioned above.

### 9.60. The Relative Clause

The relative clause does not exist in the Chinese language, but is one of the most characteristic constructions of English and its allied languages. A relative clause is a clause introduced by a relative pron. or relative adv. The essence of a relative pron. or adv. is that, while it serves its usual grammatical function in the clause, it acts at the same time as a conjunction to connect the clause with some preceding word, called its "antecedent."

The man (who came here this morning) was my school friend.

The rel. pron. who serves as a regular pronominal subject in the relative clause who to morning, but it acts also as a conjunction connecting the clause with its antecedent man. The whole relative clause is used to modify the antecedent man.

In the sentence—

We came to the room (where the emperor used to study and talk with the great scholars),

we have the rel. adv. where serving as an adv. in the clause where to scholars, and at the same time acting as a conj. to connect up the clause with the antecedent room.

The rel. promm. are who (whom, whose), which, that, as (preceded by such, the same, or as) and but (preceded by no one, etc.).

The relative advv. are where, when and why.

The use of these words will be studied in the following sections.

### 9.61. "That" as a Defining Rel. Pron

It has already been stated in §4.61 that, of the three rel. pronn. who, which and that, who is used for persons, which for things, and that for both. There is a difference, however, between that and which in their usage, namely, that that is "defining" and which is commentative. It is a difference which is hard always to observe and which is not always observed. But the observing of this distinction would always insure correctness of idiom, besides making the sentences clearer in meaning.

(A) This is the house that Jack built.
(B) Jack built this house, which was used for keeping malt.

In sentence A, the rel. clause defines, or limits, the meaning of the antecedent house. The meaning of the main clause "this is the house" would be left undefined, if the clause "that Jack built" were not added. But in sentence B, the main clause—"Jack built this house"—is quite complete in meaning, and the adding of the relative clause which to malt does not in any way limit its meaning, but only attaches a comment to it. The function of that in sentence A is, therefore, a "defining" or "demonstrative" or "determinative" function, serving to point out which one, while the function of which in sentence B is "non-defining" or "commentative," and often purely "descriptive." Further examples follow—

(A) This is the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.
- The doctor examines the rat that carries the flea that harbours the germ that infects the poor Indian.
- She was the first Chinese woman that (who) ever took a doctor's degree at Harvard.
- The man that you saw this morning is my uncle.
- It is something that can't be done in a few days.

(B) He is preaching Confucianism, which is steadily losing its influence today.
- The system of parliamentary government, which sounds so well on paper, has failed in China.
- Even if you could get the money, which isn't as easy as you think, you still would have to find the man to do it.
- So we were forced to stop at the little village, which was against our original plan.
- More and more people are beginning to learn English, which is becoming very popular in China.
- He asked me to explain to him the art of writing poetry, which cannot be taught.

Many English writers use which in the defining sense (Group A) also, but to use that in the commentative sense (Group B) would be decidedly wrong. Notice that in the B group, the relative clause could very well be left out without greatly affecting the sentence, whereas in the A group, the omission of the rel. clause would make the sentence meaningless.

The distinction between that and who is still less easy to observe, who being used both as a defining and a commentative word, while that is still used for defining only.

The man who came this morning (defining) was my school friend.
I met Mr. B—, who seemed to be a very decent fellow (commentative).

Here that could be used for who in the first sentence, but not in the second sentence.

As a rel. pron., that is always unstressed [ðət], while who and which are usually stressed.

### 9.62. "Which" as a Commentative Rel. Pron

This use has already been illustrated above. "Which" is thus often used for passing comments, remarks or personal judgments on various things. The mastery of this construction therefore leads one into one of the secrets of a personal literary style. A writer like Bernard Shaw, who is full of opinions of his own, and has all sorts of comments to make, would use a great number of such commentative phrases or clauses. On the other hand, a man who usually does not have much comment to make would not need them, and consequently his sentences would have a somewhat bald effect. Below are some more examples of parenthetical remarks or comments introduced by which.

- The protection of life and property, which is all the democracy the Chinese people need, or which is the only sort of democracy the people care for, etc.
- The League of Nations, which is a great organization for the development of oratory, etc.
- Wang is honest, which is more than you can say of most officials.
- The Japanese have violated the integrity of the Chinese Maritime Customs, which is the only support for Chinese credit at home and abroad.
- His wife wasn't beautiful, which was a sin he could not forgive.
- He entered Yenching last autumn, which is probably the best university in China.

**Exercise 82.** (A) Study the following clauses and see what sentences could be constructed to incorporate them.

- which isn't true
- which isn't quite exact
- which is a fact
- which is a pure waste of time
- which is a palpably false statement (a lie)
- which is all you want
- which was more than she had expected
- which was an accomplishment of great merit
- which might terrify less courageous people
- which is all nonsense
- which does more harm than good
- which is something that cannot be taught
- which cannot be learnt from books
- which is a question of opinion (i.e., not of fact)
- which is very questionable
- which is the desire of her parents

(B) Translate the above examples and the sentences you make into Chinese, and see how often such parenthetical remarks will have to be put in separate sentences. Compare the trans. of sentences with the that clauses in § 9.61.

### 9.63. "Which" Modifying Statements

In the two examples,—
- Yenching, which is probably the best university in China, etc.,
- His wife wasn't beautiful, which was a sin he could not forgive,

which has the n. Yenching as its proper antecedent in the first sentence, but in the second, the antecedent of which is not the adj. beautiful but the whole statement that "she wasn't beautiful," because it was this fact that her husband could not forgive. Another example should suffice—

If she pulls through the third week, which is quite probable, she will be out of danger.

It is not the week which is "probable," but the fact that she may pull through the third week.

### 9.64. In Which, from Whom, etc

It is most easy to make mistakes in employing the which and who constructions The thing that should constantly be borne in mind is that every rel. clause must have such a perfect construction in itself that it could be turned into an independent sentence. Thus, the clause which is quite probable may easily be turned into a perfect sentence, This is quite probable. But a sentence like—

We came to the room which the emperor used to work

is wrong, because we cannot say The emperor used to work the room, but have to say work in the room. Hence the sentence should read—

We came to the room in which the emperor used to work.

Following are some correct examples:—

- I got a letter yesterday from my sister, from whom I had not heard for a long time. (I had not heard from her.)
- We must work for our country, which we all love and in which we all believe. (We believe in our country.)
- He ate a lot of indigestible food immediately after his recovery from typhoid, than which there could be nothing more dangerous.
- At New York, he met the great composer, with whom he had been on most intimate terms years ago when they were studying together in Germany.
- We met Mr. Wilkinson, the great novelist, of whom I had heard such a great deal.

**Exercise 83.** Connect up the following pairs of sentences:—

1. I brought the girl to see the lawyer. To this lawyer, the father had entrusted the care of his daughter.
2. I brought the girl to see Mr. Yang. Through Mr. Yang, she obtained a new position.
3. Then we talked about communism in China. As to this (topic), there was a great diversity of opinion.
4. Then we changed over to the abolition of extra-territoriality in China. A great deal has been written about this (topic).
5. Finally we discussed the question of constitutional government. Against this, Mr. Chung expressed the most emphatic opinions.

### 9.65. Which . . . It, Which . . . Them, etc

Another frequent source of trouble comes from the writer forgetting whether which is the subject or the object in the rel. clause. Some common mistakes, with their proper corrections, are given below:—

1. We began to play billiard, which my friend had not played it for a long time. (It should be dropped, because which is already the object of played in the clause.)
2. The young bride was confronted with a series of new problems, which no one had told her about them. (Them to be dropped: which is already the object of about.)
3. They showed the two men a letter, which, when we had studied carefully, seemed to be written by a woman. (Say "when we had studied it carefully," as which is serving as the subject of seemed.)
4. I gave him a picture, which, upon looking at, he recognized it to be that of his dead brother. (Say "upon looking at it," as which is serving as the object of recognized: it after recognized to be dropped, because which is already the object of the verb in the clause.)

### 9.66. That ... to, That ... for, etc

The characteristic of that is that we cannot put a prep. before it as in the case of which (in which, for which). Such prepp. are therefore regularly left at the end of the rel. clause.

- The people that you meet with are not always the people you wish to meet. (Meet with expresses a casual or unintentional meeting; to meet a person expresses an intentional meeting, as to meet him at the station.)
- There is no sense in continuing a friendship that one no longer cares for.
- I began to realize the financial situation that he had come to.
- The subject that every one was talking about; the piano that had not yet been paid for; the debt that he is in; the person that he had referred to; the opportunity that he had prayed for; the missing letter that he had been worrying about, etc.

### 9.67. "That" Used for "in Which," "for Which," etc

That may be used instead of in which, for which, etc. as a rel. adv. when referring to time, place, way, reason, manner, etc.

- The reason that I came is, etc. (Better than for which I came).
- I don't like the way that he looks at me. (That may be omitted, see following paragraph. That=in which here.)
- You cannot treat King George with the same familiarity that (with which) you treat your younger brother.
- We are in the same position that (in which) he was a year ago.
- What we see is not communism in the sense that (in which) Russia is communist.
- The last time that I saw him, he was ill in bed.

### 9.68. "That" Dropped

In idiomatic English, both spoken and written, the rel. pron. that is very often dropped, when it is the object in the rel. clause.

- The books (that) I like.
- The people (that) I know.
- The poems he writes.
- The things he spoke about.
- The book you mentioned.
- The song everybody is singing.
- The child you love.
- The woman he married.
- The flowers she picked yesterday.
- The man he promoted.
- The business he started.
- The car he owned.
- The cigar I like.
- The money he left behind him.
- The class I belong to.

The dropping of that in these constructions is entirely in consonance with the general English tendency to shorten or abbreviate all phrase modifiers (see §9.82).

### 9.691. "As" as a Rel. Pron

Besides the regular rel. pron. who, which and that, there are two other words which often serve in the same capacity: as and but. Both these words can act as subjects in the rel. clause and at the same time as conj. to connect the clause with an antecedent. The peculiarity of these words is that they usually go with certain other preceding words. As is usually used in the phrases such . . . as, the same . . . as, and as . . . as.

- Such customers as drifted our way were generally strangers from the passing ships. (Subj. of drifted)
- There was such a confusion as might be caused by a theatre panic. (Subj.)
- She did not turn out to be such a good travelling companion as we had expected. (Obj.)
- As many men as applied were admitted. (Subj.)
- As many men as we found were taken up into the ship. (Obj.)
- We took in as many men as could be accommodated in the small ship. (Subj.)
- He came by the same route as had been followed by his predecessors. (Subj.)
- A revolution broke out, such as no one had seen before. (Obj.)

The use of as alone is also quite common:—

- The play, as is well known, is based on a famous novel.
- The ex-convict committed crimes again, as is usual (or, as is to be expected), and was arrested again.
- As is often the case; as often happens; as might be expected (As often happens, when the patient is of the nervous type, etc.)
- Many nasty things were said about him, as have been said about other people.

(NOTE.—Some grammarians have questioned the legitimacy of the above constructions, insisting on putting in another word as the subj., e.g. "as it is well known" or "as nasty things have been said about other people." Close observation, however, of this particular idiom and of the general tendency of English with regard to modifying clauses does not warrant this view. Such constructions as "as is well known," "as is often the case" are far too common and too well supported by usage to be easily banished from writing; the omission of it in as is well known is moreover in entire agreement with the peculiarly English tendency to shorten modifying clauses: see §9.82.)

### 9.692. "But" as a Rel. Pron

But as a rel. pron. is always preceded by some negative antecedent, usually no one. In this connexion, but="who . . . not," "which . . . not," "that . . . not."

- There is no one but knows (=no one who does not know=every one knows) about this affair.
- Hardly a man came to the exhibition but was surprised by the originality and boldness of his conceptions.
- Not a new man entered politics but was soon converted into an official of the old type.
- There is no habit so old but may be cured by a strong will.

### 9.70. Relative Advv. "When," "Where" and "Why"

As a rel. pron. is a conjunctive pron., so a rel. adv. is a conjunctive adv., i.e., it serves as an adv. in the rel. clause, but at the same time connects the clause with an antecedent. Except for this difference, the construction of the rel. clause itself is exactly similar to what we have been studying in the foregoing sections.

Rel. Pron. We saw the man who was a town broker.
Rel. Adv. We saw the place where the broker died.

In the second sentence, where serves as an adv. modifying died.

**The place where:—**

- We had reached a stage where it was impossible to go any further.
- Business had come to a point where increased sales did not mean increased profit.

(As antecedent-rel. adv. combined):—

- I am where I should be.
- Send him where he will be taken care of.

**The time when:—**

- He deserted her at the time when she most needed and deserved his sympathy.
- That was the morning when we had so many guests in the house.

(As antecedent-rel. adv. combined):—

- He deserted her when she most needed, etc.
- Leave when you like.

**The reason why:—**

- The reason why I came is this.
- Let us inquire into the reason why he left in such a hurry.

(As antecedent-rel. adv. combined):—

- I can't understand why he left.
- Let us inquire why he left in such a hurry.

Notice that we practically never say the manner (way) how, but simply how, or simply the way, or the manner (the way) in which:—

The way (in which) he talked to his inferiors was ridiculous, but the way (in which) he talked to his superiors was disgusting.

Wherein, whereof and wherefore (= in which, of which, for which reason) are not in common use today except in pedantic writing, poetry and legal documents, with the exception of wherefore as a n. in the phrase the whys and wherefores. Whereby (= by which) is more commonly used.

We must think of a means whereby Manchuria may be recovered by China.

Whenever and wherever are used exactly like when and where in their constructions:—

- Leave whenever you like.
- Go wherever you like.

### 9.71. "When Called," "When Resting"

Rel. clauses introduced by when and while often have their subj. and finite vb. dropped:—

- When (you are) in doubt, ask for "Capstan."
- You must come when (you are) called.
- While (he was) talking with Mr. Elliston, he was interrupted by a loud noise upstairs.
- Listen to good music whenever (it is) possible.
- You don't want to marry while (you are) studying.
- When gambling, think of your mother, and when drinking, think of your wife.
- When invited to a stranger's party, do not talk too much.
- You cannot carry on a serious conversation while playing mah-jong.
- You can carry on a most entertaining chat while (you are) on the opium couch.

Compare similar constructions with the conj. if, as, if any, if possible, if desired (=if there is any, if it is possible, if it is desired).

### 9.80. Phrase and Clause Modifiers Summarized

The above sections, §§9.30, to 9.71, cover the most important kinds of phrases and clauses in the English language. They are: the infinitive phrase, the participial phrase, the prepositional phrase and the relative clause.

The infinitive phrase may be used to modify a n. ("a lesson to learn"), an adj. ("too proud to learn"), an adv. ("too quickly to be seen"), or a whole statement ("To tell you the truth, I wasn't there"). It may also be used as a complement to complete the meaning of a finite verb ("began to see").

The participial phrase is always used to modify the subject of the related clause ("I came, acting as his representative"). The absolute part. phrase has a subj. which is modified by the participle, and the whole phrase serves to modify the main clause ("He being too weak to go, I went in his stead").

The prepositional phrase may modify a n. ("the book on the table"), or a vb. ("He came from America" / "On coming back, I found, etc.").

The relative clause may be introduced by a rel. pron. (who, which, that) or a rel. adv. (where, when, why). The rel. pron. or rel. adv. always refers to an antecedent. The antecedent is in most cases a n. ("the man who came"), but sometimes it may be a whole statement ("He says that I didn't care, which is untrue").

### 9.81. Post-Nominal Position of Modifiers

A result of the use of the modifying phrases and clauses mentioned above is that, in English, we often have modifying phrases or clauses coming after the word they modify. With the exception of the participial phrase, which may also come before the word it modifies, all these constructions always come after the word modified.

- Inf. A book to read.
- Part. A book selling for a dollar a copy.
- Rel. The book that I like.
- Prep. The book on the top shelf.

As the Chinese language depends entirely on word-order for indicating the relationship between modifier and the modified word, this post-nominal position is impossible in Chinese. We may say the modified word or the word modified in English, but not in Chinese. The Chinese language loses therefore in flexibility in this respect, and the translation of such English modifying phrases into Chinese is often cumbersome and awkward.

**Exercise 84.** Try to translate the following sentences, and observe the word-order in the Chinese translation.

1. This is the dog that worried the cat that killed the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.
2. It is untrue that I had borrowed three hundred dollars from him at five percent interest and that I had agreed to pay it back in a year.
3. It is for this reason that Japan has become a strong country.
4. I bought up the house on the corner of Kinkiang and Fukien Roads, but the house on Szechuen Road was rented.
5. I sent a letter to Mr. Jen-sen Yang, (of) No. 33, (on) Tatung Road, (in) Chungking, (in) Szechuen.
6. I found an old manuscript on the top shelf of a cabinet behind the door in the front room of the third floor.
7. Omit the second word, line 3, paragraph 4, of Lesson 37.
8. He is the third son by the second wife of Erh-lao-yeh [二老爺] of Chang family.
9. This was the first book published by the MacMillan Company.

### 9.82. Economy in Phrase and Clause Modifiers

We have found that there is a general tendency to make the modifying phrase or clause as short as possible. In certain constructions, words are often dropped (ellipsis). The clearest examples are:—

- The man (that) I killed. (§9.68)
- I found the handkerchief (that) you lost the other day.
- Don't talk while (you are) working. (§9.71)
- Send it to me, when (it is) finished.
- Give it to me when (it is) ready.
- He dropped in on Monday evening, as (it) was usual, or as (it was) usual. (§9.691)
- The reason that (=for which) I came is this. (§9.87) Or, the reason (that) I came, etc.

Notice also such extremely short constructions as all told (=if you tell, or count, all), everything considered (=when you consider everything), weather permitting (=if weather permits), see §9.42.

This economy of expression in modifying phrases and clauses is natural, because they are logically less important than the main clause.

By means of such economy of expression, the English language has attained a greater simplicity and ease than the German language, for instance.

### 9.83. The Nominal Phrase

The law of economy has resulted in another type of phrase very similar to the absolute participial phrase mentioned in § 9.42.

(a) He was carried into the house, head first (= with his head first).
(b) I can win it hands down (= without trouble).
(c) We walked together, arm in arm.
(d) He was carried into the hospital, his face a mass of bleeding flesh.
(e) The nurse entered the room, pencil in hand, to take down the patient's name and address.
(f) Bit by bit, the patient recovered.

In each of the above sentences, there is a descriptive phrase introduced by a n. followed by a word or phrase modifying it.

The absolute participial phrase may be considered as a special kind of nominal phrase. It differs from the others only in having the n. followed by a participle (as weather permitting, everything considered).

### 9.84. Joining of Phrases

It most frequently happens that several rel. clauses or several participial phrases come together in a sentence, giving us the which ... and which or —ing ... and —ing construction. Instead of and, sometimes but is used. This is a very useful construction and quite simple, so long as the writer keeps to this formula.

(a) Having finished his official business and wishing to take a little rest, the king returned to the country.

(b) To be a millionaire is an ambition, which many people cherish, but which few people can fulfil.

The great danger is that the student often uses and which, or and —ing, where no and is required at all. The following example shows a very common error:—

We had a most enjoyable picnic party and not returning till sunset.

Here the and is totally uncalled-for.

**Exercise 85.** Straighten up the confused grammatical constructions in the following sentences:—

2. We were shown the big pearl which looking as big as a green pea.
3. The pearl had been given by the Empress Dowager to Li Lien-ying, and who was her court favourite.
4. A curio merchant found it sewn onto a silk gown, stolen by a family servant, and which was sold to a pawn-shop.
5. A Japanese soldier entered the curio shop one day, saw the big pearl, took the gown away and not paying for it.

### 9.90. The Predicate Complements

A predicate consists either of a finite vb. alone or of a finite vb. and anything else necessary to complete its meaning. Thus the object him in I killed him is also considered a complement of the vb. killed. In §9.31 "b," we have also studied the type began to see, where the infinitive to see serves also as a complement to complete the meaning of began. There are, however, other types of complements which serve as modifiers either of the subject or of the object.

Modifying the subject:—
(a) He was elected president.
(b) He grew pale.

Modifying the object:—
(c) We made him president.
(d) I found him sitting alone.
(e) I made him go.

In "a" and "c" we have nn. acting as modifiers, and in "b" and "d" we have other kinds of words—adj., participles, etc.—acting as modifiers. The case "e" will be treated in the following section separately.

**Exercise 86.** Study the following carefully and see whether the subject or the object is modified by the word or phrase in italics.

1. His younger brother turned communist.
2. He became president (or the president) of the company.
3. We called him a fool.
4. We considered him the ablest man of the group.
5. The work is considered perfect (or finished).
6. I found him naked and half crazy.
7. I found the child in a ditch and unable to get out of it.
8. It is thought best to let him alone.
9. His wife described him like a fool.
10. I found her waiting alone in the room.
11. This made me furious.
12. This turned him crazy.
13. Boil the egg soft.
14. He was made King of Iran.
15. He played the fool.
16. He got well.
17. Make it nice and dainty.
18. Hang it high in the air.
19. I found the money gone.
20. The girl looks very pretty.

### 9.91. "I made him go"

This requires special consideration. Here an action is predicated of the object, and we may have the following forms:—

(a) The action may be passive from the point of view of the object, as—

- Have the shoes repaired.
- Have the letter mailed.
- Have the linen sent out to be washed.
- Have a doctor sent for.
- I want to see the building finished.
- I would rather see you damned first. (An impolite form of refusal)
- Keep the money locked in the safe.

These all suggest or indicate something to be done to the object. Hence the past participle is used.

(b) The action may be active from the point of view of the object, in which case the vb. expressing it is put in the infinitive. After the vbb. make, let, see and hear, the to of the infinitive is regularly dropped; after help and bid, it is sometimes dropped and sometimes retained; after all other words, like ask, allow, want, command, urge, request, etc., it is always expressed.

(I) I made him go.
- I saw him go up the stairs.
- I heard him say (not said) that Mr. Liu was ill.
- Why not let him go?
- Let me pass.
- Make him wait outside (pay for it).

(II) Help him finish (or to finish) the job.
- This will help pay (or to pay) the week's rent.
- Won't you let me help you do it? (Better than to do it.)
- Bid him go (or to go) away.

(III) Allow him to finish his supper.
- I am not allowed to (do anything).
- I could not ask him to do it.
- Order some food to be brought to my room.

(c) There is a difference between I saw him go up the stairs and I saw him going up the stairs. The former expresses an action, while the second expresses a condition, exactly similar to sentence 10 in Exercise 86 of §9.90: I found her waiting alone in the room.
