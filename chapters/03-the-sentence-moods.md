## THE SENTENCE MOODS

### 3.10. What is a Sentence?
When we say a red rose, this is not a sentence, because we feel there is only a group of words which does not say anything. What about the red rose? If we say, however, The rose is red, we feel we do say something and the meaning is complete. We say, therefore, that a red rose is not a sentence, but The rose is red is a sentence. Similarly, in Here's a red rose, The red rose smells sweet, or Her face is like a red rose, we feel each is a sentence, because each says something and the meaning is complete in itself. If we look carefully, we find it is always the verb (smells, is) that gives life to the whole sentence. On the other hand, in a red rose, the meaning is dead, because there is no verb.

But suppose a man should tell you suddenly that your house has been burnt down, you naturally exclaim "What!" There is no verb in the exclamation, and yet don't we feel What! is a complete expression expressing a complete meaning? The man who first sees the fire would most probably exclaim "Fire!" and the man upstairs in the house, on hearing the cry, would also cry out "Help!" All these are complete and independent expressions. They express their meaning fully and clearly. We should not say Fire! or What? is not a sentence because there is no verb in it. Grammar is made for language and not language for grammar. Living language is not always like a school exercise. In actual speech, we do often use expressions that contain no verbs in them, and yet the meaning is as complete as in any sentence. Sometimes the verb is understood (not expressed), but this is not always true. We may say, for the sake of grammar, that Fire! is really There is a fire shortened. But this is psychologically not true: when we cry out "Fire!", we really only want to call people's attention to the fire. We may mean There is a fire, but we may also mean Let everybody go and fight the fire! or we may mean Oh! now my property is all gone, and what shall I do? Our real meaning is just that word fire. Also, ordinarily, a red rose is not a sentence, but in answer to the question "What have you got in your hand?", "A red rose" is a good, clear and complete answer. Again, after arranging with a friend to meet again on Saturday morning, we may say before parting:—

All right. Or—
All right. Saturday morning at ten. Or—
All right. Saturday morning at ten in the North Station and no mistake.

All this is perfectly good English, although in written English, we generally try to put in the proper verb. In the same way, we have the following colloquial expressions:—

- Your turn. (=Now it is your turn.)
- Next! (=Next boy, stand up, etc.)
- Splendid! (=That's good! Well done!)
- How so? (=How can it be?)
- A drink? (=Do you want a drink?)
- Nothing doing. (=I will never do it.)
- My mistake. (=It's my mistake: it's not your fault.)
- Light, please. (=Please turn on the light.)
- Danger ahead! (=Drive slowly.)
- The idea! (=How can you, he, etc. think of such a thing?)

Since there are such colloquial expressions, we must say that a sentence is simply a complete and independent expression. Any complete and independent expression may be called a sentence.

### 3.11. Importance of Finite Verb
The above cases, however, are exceptions. Generally, a sentence must have a verb in it. In answer to the question "What have you got there?", the answer "A red rose" is quite complete. But usually, a red rose says nothing and cannot be called a sentence. Likewise, Soochow-Nanking is not a sentence, but only a group of words. I go from Soochow to Nanking is a sentence, because here the finite verb (2.30) gives life to the sentence and connects the parts into a whole.

We must remember to use a verb in every sentence, because this is an important English habit, and because Chinese students often forget it. Adjectives and participles (verbs changed into adjectives) alone cannot say anything. We can say He dies (verb), but not He dead (adjective). We must say He is dead. Nor can we say The man playing in the garden as a sentence, but we must say The man is playing, etc.

Exercise 13. Supply verbs like is, feel, become, get, grow, etc. in the following sentences:—

1. — you fifteen years old?
2. I — sick for a long time.
3. My father — very angry with me.
4. Soon we — very tired.
5. The baby cries when it — hungry.
6. The students — returning from school.
7. Her sister — more beautiful than she.
8. The girl's toy — broken, and she — very sorry.
9. She — weaker and weaker on account of illness.

### 3.20. Sentence, Phrase and Clause
#### 3.21. Subject, Predicate and Principal Verb
If we analyze any sentence, we find we have a subject and a predicate. The subject is what we talk about, and the predicate is what we say about the subject. Thus in The rose is red, rose is the subject of the sentence, and is red is the predicate. In Open your books, the subject you is understood, and Open your books is the predicate. The important word in the predicate is always the principal verb.

Exercise 14. Find the predicate and principal verb in the following:—

1. The kite flies in the air. (The answer to the question "What about the kite?" give the predicate.)
2. What makes the steam-engine run?
3. George O'Brien knocked the fellow down.
4. Please show him the way.

#### 3.22. Direct and Indirect Objects
Some predicates contain objects of the principal verbs. In the first sentence above, the verb flies has no object. In the second, steam-engine is the object of the verb makes. In the third, fellow is the object of the verb knocked. And in the fourth sentence, we have two objects, (show) him, and (show) the way. Here the meaning is the same as Please show the way to him. A person (or sometimes a thing) for whom or to whom a thing is done is called the indirect object of the verb. Find out the direct and indirect objects in the following:—

1. Give me that book, please.
2. Tell your mother everything you have done.
3. Will you return me the money I lent you?
4. Miss Yang paid her friend a visit last month.
5. Will you do me a favour?
6. His father bought him a new hat.
7. My brother made me a kite.

#### 3.23. Sentence Structure: Modifiers and Conjunctions
We have seen that the important parts in a sentence are the subject, the principal verb, and sometimes also the object. This is clear and easy to remember. All sentences are made up this way, no matter how long they are. They are sometimes very long because we add words or groups of words to modify the subject, the verb or the object, and join these groups by conjunctions. So we can classify all parts of a sentence into these five kinds: (1) subject, (2) principal verb, (3) object, (4) modifiers, and (5) conjunctions. The sentence—"The dirty boy plucked a beautiful red rose in your garden this morning, and was caught."—may be analyzed as follows:—

- Subject—boy.
- First verb—plucked.
- Second verb—was caught.
- Object of 1st verb—rose.
- Modifier of subject—the, dirty.
- Modifier of 1st verb—in your garden, this morning.
- Modifier of object—a, beautiful, red.
- Conjunction joining the 2 verbs—and.

It will be remembered that adjectives, adverbs, and prepositional phrases are always used as modifiers. Exclamations are regarded as independent parts in the sentence, as Ah! here he is. The structure of the English sentence is really as simple as this, and if we remember these five kinds of sentence parts, we can understand the structure of English sentences better.

Exercise 15. Find out the subject, principal verb, object, modifiers, and conjunctions (if any), in the following sentences, and show what the modifiers modify. In The carpenter paints the door red, red modifies the object door. In My uncle grew angry, angry modifies the subject uncle, and in He was considered lost (They considered him lost), lost modifies the subject he. So words inside the predicate may modify the subject.

1. Columbus discovered America by luck.
2. Magellan sailed around the world.
3. Magellan made the first sailing trip around the world.
4. He got angry with me, and called me an impossible fool.
5. The sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening.
6. He left home for a long time, and was considered dead by his family.
7. Spell your words correctly, and copy them with ink, not with pencil.
8. Meet me at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.
9. I saw him crossing the street.
10. He was seen walking with Miss C—.
11. The detective came too late, and found the thief gone and the room quite empty.

#### 3.24. Phrase and Clause
Parts of a sentence which have a subject and predicate are called clauses, and those which don't are called phrases. A clause is thus like an independent sentence in structure; it is in fact a sentence within a sentence. A phrase is simply a group of words without any finite verb. A clause is always connected with the rest of the sentence by some conjunction. Study the following clauses in italics, and notice the conjunction introducing them.

1. If you do not find him, come back and tell me.
2. He was on his way back, when he met Mr. Atkinson.
3. I shall always remember how he treated me, as long as I live.
4. That he was killed is certain.
5. Why he went away nobody knows.

Find out the subject and principal verb in each of the above clauses.

A phrase may be a prepositional phrase (beginning with a preposition, as in the garden, by his family), an infinitive phrase ("to" followed by a verb, as to see it, to be seen), a participial phrase (beginning with a participle, as crossing the street, singing a song), or any combination of words that does not contain a finite verb. For instance, we have the phrases as soon as (conjunction), once upon a time (adverb), on account of (preposition), etc.

Phrases and clauses are used as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs just like single words. Generally they are used as nouns or as modifiers (adjectives or adverbs). The noun clause will be studied in Chapter XII, while all the important phrases and clauses used as modifiers (the infinitive, prepositional and participial phrases and the relative clause) will be studied in the important chapter on Modification (Chapter IX).

### 3.30. Sentence Moods
One way of studying the English sentence is to learn how the various sentence moods are expressed, such as the moods of questioning, affirming, denying, commanding, and those expressing doubt, hope, wish, promise, etc. It is hard to say exactly how many sentence moods there are: they vary as much as our moods or feelings vary. But, for the sake of convenience, we may say there are the following five main kinds: (1) Affirmation, (2) Negation, (3) Interrogation, (4) the Potential Moods (of command, wish, promise, etc.), and (5) Emotional Utterances (or exclamations). The study of these sentence moods teaches us, (1) how to state a fact, (2) how to deny, (3) how to ask questions, (4) how to express a wish, a supposition or anything that may or may not be fact, and (5) how to make exclamations in English under the stress of emotion.

#### 3.31. Chinese and English Compared: Chinese Modal Particles
A foreigner studying the Chinese language would have also to study the various Chinese sentence moods. He would find that the Chinese largely use modal particles (or particles expressing a mood, a kind of "empty words" or "form-words" 虛字, as against "substance-words" 實字) to express the different sentence moods, which are expressed in English largely by the verbs. Thus we use ma (嗎) to express the questioning mood, ni (呢) to express the question of unbelief, refutation, or disagreement, la (了) to express the sense of completion, pa (罷, 吧) to express final decision or command, etc. These particles always come at the end of the sentence. Sometimes these moods are expressed by conjunctions or adverbs in the beginning or middle of the sentence, as nan tao (難道) for expressing disbelief, chueh (卻) for expressing admission, liao-hsiang (料想) or tsung (總) for expressing a supposition or conjecture, etc.

The following are examples:—

- 你也要去嗎？ Are you going, too? (Question)
- 他何必這樣呢？ Then why should he do so? (Refutation)
- 十二點了。 It's twelve o'clock already. (Completion)
- 我早已知道了。 I knew it long ago. (Past)
- 走罷。 Let's go. Be gone! (Decision)
- 算了罷。 Have done with it! (Finishing off)
- 難道他沒看見我麼？ Could it be that he didn't see me? (Disbelief)
- 他卻有點難過。 He did feel a little ashamed. (Admission)
- 料想他總不至如此罷。 I don't think he is as bad as that. (Conjecture)

### 3.40. Affirmation: I Do, I Am
Affirming, or stating a fact, is the most general form of a sentence. Thus in such simple sentences as He goes, It rains, The king is pleased, or I have been away, we are making an affirmation or a statement. In English, the verb is the important word used in making a statement. Thus, in He is a thief, the real important word that affirms is the word is, and in He sells his house, the affirming word is the verb sells. The verbs is and sells represent the two big classes of verbs from the point of view of affirmation, viz. (1) the verbs of doing, and (2) the verbs of being. In fact, almost all English verbs are considered as verbs of doing, and only the various forms of the verb "to be" (is, was, are, were) are considered as verbs expressing "being." This is quite an English way of thinking, new to the Chinese student. Thus, we may substitute the verb "do" (with its various forms, did and does) for almost any verb. E.g., in answer to the question "Does he sell his house?", we usually say, "Yes, he does." And the same may be applied to any verb of doing. Study the following statements:—

(A) THE VERBS OF DOING:

- I believe in him. Indeed I do.
- Tsu-fah comes to borrow money again.— He always does.
- You wear a straw hat in winter. You ought to know that it is not proper to do that. You never see people doing it except yourself.
- Did you meet him?— Yes, I did.
- Did you speak to him?— No, I didn't.
- Shall I bring you today's papers?— Please do.
- I don't like geography. Really I don't.
- You are the only one that likes my writing. Others don't.
- Do you promise to take her for your wife?— I do.

(B) THE VERB "TO BE" (followed by adjective or participles):

- Do you think he is a real scholar?— I don't think he is.
- Some of them are asleep, and some are not.
- I suspected that he was in love, and now I know he is.
- You say that she is the daughter of a cook. Well, what if she is.
- I admire great speakers. I like to be one myself.

Exercise 16. Read the above sentences again and again. Then the teacher will say the first part, and let the students supply the second part orally.

#### 3.41. Can, Will, Have, Must, etc.
From the above, we see already that the words "do" and "be" are the words we use in order to make an affirmation, a denial, or an interrogation. "To do" and "to be" are called auxiliary or helping verbs. In fact, we chiefly depend upon these helping verbs in forming all sorts of affirmative, negative and interrogative sentences. There are other helping verbs like have, will, can, may, must, dare, need, etc., and these, too, are often used for the same purpose as do and be. Repeat the following sentences with the words can, must, etc. stressed:—

- Can he or can he not get the things ready?—Yes, he can.
- My wife does not want me to go, but I must.
- You are free to go. You may if you want to.
- He thinks I have not yet prepared my lesson, but I have.
- "You shall not come this way." "But I will."

#### 3.42. Affirmative Replies
We generally use "yes" in affirmative answers. But it is often desirable to make better answers than the blunt "yes." Every language has various ways of expressing agreement, and politeness requires that we say something more than a mere "yes" when answering to any request. Following are some examples:—

- May I see this book? — Certainly. Of course.
- Can I have a cigarette? — Why, certainly.
- May I smoke here? — Please do.
- Could you let me talk with you for a moment? — With pleasure.
- Shall I shut the door? — If you please.
- So I have to take care of her? — Quite so.
- Am I to hand in the exercises tomorrow? — Exactly.
- You will do everything I wish? — Absolutely.
- And she is your sister's daughter? — Quite right. You are right.
- Does he know you are living here? — I think so.
- Can I stay in school during the spring vacation? — Yes, if you like.
- Shall I tell her to come and see you? — By all means. Yes, if she wants to.

Exercise 17. The teacher will give some questions, and let the students use some of the above phrases for answers.

#### 3.43. Qualified Assertion
Both politeness and care for exactness of expression require that we often qualify our assertions with I think, I am afraid, it seems, etc. What you think is a bad man is quite different from just a bad man, and what seems to be all right may not be all right. The phrases, it seems, I think, I believe (and the American I guess) are often inserted into the sentence as qualifying phrases, either at the beginning, the middle, or the end.

- I think I can do it myself.
- This can do you good, I think.
- That is, I think, too much for me.
- I don't think she will come by six.
- He is gone, I believe.
- I believe he is gone.
- I believe I'd better go.
- Then you don't believe it is true?
- It seems she is unhappy.
- She is unhappy, it seems.
- She seems to be unhappy.
- It seems to me that she is unhappy.
- You seem to think..........
- It doesn't seem to be of any use to anyone.
- They seem to like each other.
- Apparently, they like each other.
- How old do you think I am?—You are eighteen, I suppose?
- Can you come to dine with us?—No, I am afraid I can't.
- You have been to Nanking, if I am not mistaken.

Exercise 18. Make some sentences with some of the above phrases.

#### 3.44. Emphatic Assertion
Sometimes we want to emphasize a statement or assertion. This may be done by a special use of the verb do; by the use of certain adverbs, by double negatives (§ 3.45) and by a method of interrogative affirmation (§ 3.46). I do feel sorry for him is an emphatic way of saying that I feel sorry for him. Other examples are:—

- Do tell me everything you know; otherwise I cannot help you.
- 'Tisn't (=It isn't) that he doesn't know it. He does know it, but he does not want to let people know.
- Well, I confess I did go to the gambling house.
- You need not lie to me. You did go to that place, and many people saw you there.

The word do or did is always stressed in these places. Ladies are especially fond of using this form of emphasis even when no great emphasis is meant. E.g.—

- Please do write me often.
- I do hope that you will quit drinking.
- I do fear something is wrong, dear.
- Do be kind to this poor little boy.

Sometimes we show emphasis by merely stressing the verb. Sometimes various adverbs are used. The force of I am sure is already weakened by constant use, so that I am sure you will find him is actually less assertive than the short categorical statement You will find him. Generally the shorter a statement is, the more forceful it is. I dare say is even weaker, and simply means "It is quite possible," or "You are probably right." The Americans are very fond of using you bet, or you bet your life or sure (with long-drawn-out pronunciation like sh-oo-r) as a means of assertion or affirmation.

- You are funny. (Emphasis by stress or accent.)
- Do I look like a banker only? I am a banker. (Said by a self-satisfied merchant.)
- You ask me whether I am going to see the show? You bet I am. (Or, one of the following forms:) Why, of course, I am. Certainly I am. Sure I am.
- You are indeed funny. You are really funny.
- May I have your dictionary for a moment?—(1) Why, certainly. (2) Certainly. (3) Of course.
- I am sure you will like the book.
- No doubt,
- There is no doubt,
- Undoubtedly,
- Beyond a doubt,
- Beyond any doubt,
- Beyond all question,
- Without any question,
- As sure as eggs is eggs. (=Undoubtedly.) (common form of assertion)

Exercise 19. Make sentences with some of the following adverbs or adverb phrases: undoubtedly, unquestionably, decidedly, no doubt, beyond any question, indeed, certainly, I am sure, etc.

#### 3.45. English Reticence and Double Negatives
The English are a reticent nation, and they have reserved forms of saying things which in other languages might be expressed by rather strong adverbs. Not half bad is what Americans would express by Isn't that lovely?, Isn't it grand? or what a Frenchman would express by ravissant (ravishing, delightful), and is the equivalent of Chinese hao chi la (好極了). According to a great authority on the English language, She is rather good-looking (literally, 還好看) is the strongest praise you can draw from an Englishman for a woman's looks. And where a Frenchman would say extremely or infinitely (extrêmement, infiniment), an Englishman says only very or rather or pretty.*

*Otto Jespersen: Growth and Structure of English Language, p. 2.

The use of double negatives is often one of these reserved forms of showing emphasis. By no means bad means rather good indeed, and not half a bad fellow means quite a nice fellow. He didn't half swear means He swore violently. A not undistinguished guest means a very distinguished guest; and He was by no means unwelcome means He was greatly welcome. See if you can use the following phrases:—

1. there is no one but knows (=every one knows)
2. not inferior (=quite up to the mark)
3. spent no small amount (=spent a great deal)
4. was not indifferent to (=did care for)
5. a not too clean shirt (=dirty shirt)
6. none too kind (=rather unkind)
7. none too good for him (=rather bad for him)

The Chinese language has also expressions like 未可厚非 (not to be blamed too much, or quite excusable), or 不為無故 (not without reason, with good reason). This use of double negatives is sometimes quite expressive and useful, but is after all rather roundabout, and may sometimes seem affected or unnatural. For I ain't got nothing, see § 3.56.

#### 3.46. Affirmation by a Retort Question
This way of asserting a thing by asking an obvious question is quite common in all languages. A. may ask B. "Do you love her?" The most emphatic answer B. could give would be, "Do I love her!" The force of this retort question is "Is it necessary to ask? Do I love myself?" Very often, too, we put the assertion or affirmation in the form of a simple question, as Isn't it pretty?, meaning How pretty it is! This kind of question is really a kind of exclamation. The word why, added to the beginning of a sentence, is also only a means of emphasis, meaning of course, naturally, it is not necessary to ask, why do you ask that question?

- If he should lose, why, he has millions in the foreign banks, and can go and live in the foreign concessions.
- If the people protest, why, I can say I am carrying out Dr. Sun's program of national reconstruction.
- If the other generals accuse me of "squeeze," why, don't they do the same?
- Why, of course. Take all you want. I would be only too glad to help you.
- Why does he ask about me? Doesn't he know me?
- (A mother may say:) Haven't I nursed him from his childhood, fed him, cared for him, and brought him up, and given him a chance in life? Haven't I sacrificed my whole life for him? And now you ask, "Do I love him?"
- How dare you say such a thing against your own mother?
- Am I the boss, or is he the boss? (How dare he interfere with my business?)

### 3.50. Negation
Like affirmation, English negation largely depends on the use of the helping verbs do, be, can, shall, may, must, etc, with the adverb not. Even more than the affirmative sentence, the negative sentence depends on the word do. In fact do not (with did not, does not) is the commonest form used. Chinese students should learn from the very beginning to use this form, instead of saying He not knows, or He not comes, which is a literary translation of Chinese 他不知, 他不來. The difficulty lies in remembering to use the word do, and in the changes in the verb which go with it. Thus we have—

AFFIRMATION | NEGATION
--- | ---
I come (go, play). | I do not come (go, play).
I came (went, played). | I did not come (go, play).
He comes (goes, plays). | He does not come (go, play).

The forms cannot, are not, will not, must not, etc. offer no difficulty. Can not is the emphatic form of cannot. The changes came and did come, comes and does come occur also in the question, so that we can have the following forms for practice:—

PRESENT | PAST
--- | ---
(A) He comes | (A) He came
(B) Does he come? | (B) Did he come?
(C) He does not come. | (C) He did not come.

Notice also that we say (1) He need not come, He dare not come, but (2) He needs to come, He dares to come, and (3) Dare (Need) he come? or Does he dare (need) to come?

Exercise 20. Practise the following orally, until you can do it naturally and without mistake. Vary the sentences according to the three forms 'A,' "B," and "C":—

1. He knows that I am here.
2. They saw me on Nanking Road.
3. He heard the shot.
4. You spoke to that fellow on the way.
5. They all ran away when the police came.
6. The teacher saw me, but did not see him. (The teacher did not — me, but — him).

#### 3.51. Aren't, Isn't Mustn't, etc.
Regarding the pronunciation of helping words plus not, some practice is necessary. Some students have learnt English for many years without knowing how to pronounce these short forms correctly, and thus make their pronunciation unnecessarily complicated. The word not, when not contracted with the helping verbs is never slurred, but always retains the "short o" pronunciation. Ain't for is not, are not, am not, have not (as shown below in the last example) is, however, not accepted in the language of educated people.

- mustn't    ['mæsnt]    ['mæsn]    You mustn't say so.
- don't      [dount]      [doun]     I don't know.
- doesn't    ['dæznt]    ['dæzn]    That doesn't matter.
- isn't      ['iznt]      ['izn]      That isn't true.
- wasn't     ['wɔznt]    ['wɔzn]    I wasn't there.
- aren't     [ɑːnt]       [ɑːn]      They aren't so bad.
- weren't    ['wɜːrnt]   ['wɜːn]    We weren't going to do it.
- can't      [kænt]       [kæn]      I can't do it. ([kænt] in American speech.)
- won't      [woʊnt]     [woʊn]     He won't tell me.
- shan't     [ʃɑːnt]     [ʃɑːn]     You shan't go away yet.
- needn't    ['niːdnt]   ['niːdn]    You needn't be afraid.
- didn't     ['dɪdnt]    ['dɪdn]     That didn't do any good.
- wouldn't   ['wʊdnt]    ['wʊdn]     It wouldn't be wise to take such a step.
- shouldn't  ['ʃʊdnt]    ['ʃʊdn]    Why shouldn't he go?
- couldn't   ['kʊdnt]    ['kʊdn]     That couldn't be done.
- ain't     [eɪnt]      [eɪn]      "I ain't done nothing wrong by speaking to the gentleman," said Liza, the flower girl.

To say mustn't ['mæsn], as in You mustn't do a thing like that is easier and nicer than to say must not. It is very important, therefore, that one should learn to pronounce these contracted forms.

Exercise 21. Practise on the pronunciation of the following:—

1. She won't ask me for money.
2. It couldn't be true that he was a traitor.
3. I shan't do it, anyhow.
4. Repetition is good, but you mustn't repeat mistakes.
5. You can write poems, can't you?
6. Isn't he your bosom friend?
7. They needn't go to his office now.
8. Didn't your brother tell you so?
9. Some boys are studying, and some aren't.
10. Wasn't it a good idea to go to the Taishan Mountains and look at the sunrise there?
11. Miss Wang doesn't want to play volley-ball.
12. You like to have a sea bath, don't you?

#### 3.52. No, Not a, Not Any, Nothing, etc.
We generally say There is no one, but There is not any one, and I have no money, but I cannot pay. No is thus used as an adjective before nouns, and not is used as an adverb. When there is a noun, it is better to use no. It is better to say There is no one than to say There is not any one. The form with no is often more emphatic. Thus That is no easy task is more emphatic than That is not an easy task. In this way, we get the common expressions, no good, no fun, no use.

- The pen is no good.
- It is no use talking (or to talk).
- That's no fun.
- Talking is no use.
- This camera is no use.
- It's no go (=nothing can be done).

This camera is no use is more expressive than This camera is not of any use. Some careful writers like to say This camera is of no use, but they never say That's of no fun. Instead of saying I do not know anything, or I do not know anybody, we can say, of course, I know nothing, or I know nobody. It is shorter and easier.

Exercise 22. Use no, nobody, nothing, none in the following sentences and change them in any way you like:—

1. I have not received any answer from him.
2. I have not seen any Chinese in this city.
3. They do not know any way to solve the problem.
4. He doesn't have money to pay me.
5. I tell you I do not have any lover.
6. I asked him but he could not tell me anything.
7. Don't tell this to anybody (any one).
8. This fountain pen cannot be of any use to me.
9. Is this watch any good? (Answer in the negative.)
10. Does any one know of your coming? (Answer in the negative.)

#### 3.53. Few, a Few, Little, a Little
In English, the meaning of few and little is negative, while that of a few and a little is affirmative. When you come to borrow money from me, and I say "I have little money," that means I am not going to lend it to you. But when I say "Yes, I have a little," this means I am willing to lend you what little I have. I have little time for you means I have not much time, or even practically the same as I have no time for you. He talks a little English should be translated as 他會講一點英文, but He talks little English means 他英文不大會講. Study the following:—

- You have little time left. You'd better hurry up.
- I have a little time left. What can I do for you?
- He knows a little French, but does not talk about it.
- She knows little, but she talks a whole lot.
- There is little use talking. He will never listen to you.
- Oh, it has a little use. It will make him know that I do not approve.
- I saw a few people there, and had a good talk with them.
- I saw few people there, as most of them had gone away.

#### 3.54. "No" in Negative Answers
It is a peculiar English habit that, when the sentence itself is negative, we must use no in the beginning, even when in Chinese yes would be the proper word to use. Whenever we use not in the sentence, we must also use no, and not yes. A sentence like Yes, he will not come is highly unidiomatic in English.

- Q. Isn't he your brother?
- A. No, he is not.
- Q. Haven't you got your book?
- A. No, I haven't.
- Q. You are not going away tomorrow, are you?
- A. No, I am not going. (never say: Yes, I am not going.)
- Q. And you don't mind missing this trip?
- A. No, I don't mind. (never say: Yes, I don't mind.)

#### 3.55. Emphatic Negation
There are various ways of making strong negatives by the use of certain phrases, by a retort question (as in emphatic affirmation), or sometimes by an obviously impossible statement. As a strong negative is often very useful, one should learn at least some of these phrases. Some of the commonest ones are seen in the following:—

- Tsung-chang feels not the least bit sorry for his brother's death.
- He is not at all sorry.
- He is by no means sorry.
- Far from it. (He is far from being sorry.)
- Most certainly not.
- Absolutely not.
- He does not remember at all when or how the watch was lost.
- I cannot possibly allow you to do that.
- That watch has no earthly use for me.
- He hasn't got a blessed penny.
- Not a single man remained.
- He didn't understand a single word of it.
- There is none whatsoever.
- None of your impudence!
- None of your nonsense!
- He is not a bit ashamed.

Exercise 23. Make sentences with some of the above phrases.

Sometimes an obviously untrue question is used for negation, as—

- He a gentleman? (What nonsense that is!)
- Am I my brother's keeper? (Is that my duty?)
- Chang failed in mathematics? (Chang is the best student in mathematics.)
- Chiang an honest man? (You know jolly well he isn't.)
- Can the Dragon King be short of treasures? (He is famous for his treasures.)

Some apparently affirmative sentences have really a negative force, especially the common I should worry, meaning What do I care? (That does not worry me). Catch me going to the church also implies that you will never find me there. This is similar to the Chinese 你聽他話的 (literally, You listen to that fellow's words), meaning Don't believe what he says, or 我怕他! (literally, I afraid of him!), meaning I am not afraid.

#### 3.56. "I ain't got nothing."
In English vulgar speech, it is quite common to hear expressions like I ain't got nothing, I don't never want no help from nobody, He can't do nothing without my help. It would seem that the meaning from the combination of two negatives would be positive or affirmative, but actually this is only an English way of emphasizing the negative. He can't do nothing really means He can do nothing. In repeating these negatives, the speaker is only taking pains to make his negative meaning clear and unmistakable, for fear that one negative alone might not be heard.* This use of repeated negatives is not allowed in the speech of higher-class society.

*Jespersen: Philosophy of Grammar, p. 333.

On the other hand, the repetition of not in separate phrases is quite necessary to make the meaning clear. We say, for instance, He wouldn't come to your house, not even the King himself should ask him to / He would never take opium, not even as a medicine / He would not take a bath, not even if you offer him all the chocolates in the world. In the same way, we use neither ... nor as being probably clearer than either ... or in the following, although either ... or would be also correct: He cannot write a single decent Chinese essay, neither in peh-hua, nor in the literary language.

#### 3.57. Conditional Negation
The repetition of not in negative clauses or phrases discussed in the preceding paragraph is quite often used in English. If a man asks you if you could write an English letter for him, and you do not mean to refuse him entirely, although you are too busy at the present moment, your answer should be "Not now, I am afraid" (cf. Pekingese 現在不). This may be called conditional negation, or partial negation. Following are some more examples:—

- (Question asked on a September morning:) Who will come and take a sea bath with me?—Not I. (=Others may go, but not I.)
- Didn't he give the fellow some money also?—Not he! (=He is a miser.)
- Are you going on the same boat with him?—Not if I can help it. (=I will not go on the same boat, if I can avoid it.)
- Hasn't he published a book of poems?—Not any that I know of.
- Will the foreigners never be friendly to China?—Some of them, yes, but not all. Or: Not until you show them a big navy.
- Will Japan ever stop her aggressions on China?—No, no, not until we take measures of actual resistance.
- Are you never going to take a little vacation?—Not until I finish this book of mine.
- Let us start the bonfire now.—Not so soon. Wait till the guests have all come.

Exercise 24. Make sentences with some of the phrases: not now, not I, not so soon, not if, not that, not until.

The case of All that glitters is not gold is quite peculiar to English. It really means Not all that glitters is gold.

### 3.60. Interrogation
In our study of English affirmative and negative sentences, we have learnt that the question is often used as a form of emphatic assertion or denial. It has also been shown (§ 3.50) that the forms He came and Did he come? require some special practice. Now there are five main types of questions: (1) by simple inversion of word-order between verb and subject, (2) by addition of helping verbs, (3) by the use of interrogative pronouns or adverbs (who, what, which, when, where, why and how), (4) by the tag-question, and (5) by mere questioning tone without change of word-order or interrogative words.* In all except the last type, the verb-before-subject word-order (or "inverted word-order") is used.

*It would be foolish to force the students to remember these five types as so many convenient pills to swallow. Grammar becomes uninteresting the moment this spirit of learning formulas and dead enumerations enters. It is much more important that the students know how each form is used to express our ideas. No Englishman is ever conscious of these five types. Nor is the knowledge of these types of any use to him: the use consists in his ability to employ them to express his living meaning.

(1) Knowest thou that I am the King of Persia?
(2) Do you know that the president has resigned?
(3) When did he resign? What president?
(4) So he has resigned, has he?
(5) He has resigned? (With rising tone at the end.)

The first type, so much used in Old English is now replaced by the modern second type. With the helping verbs can, must, etc., we simply use can you? must I? etc. (i.e., according to Type One).

#### 3.61. Will You? Won't You?
It is natural that we expect a negative answer with an affirmative question and an affirmative answer with a negative question. This is especially true of the negative question and it applies to all languages. In Chinese, 是不是 implies 是, and 豈有此理 implies 決無此理. But the actual usage of these negative questions varies with different languages. Thus won't you? is much more commonly used in English than in Chinese. We say Won't you sit down? in English as an invitation to sit down, whereas the Chinese 不坐一會嗎? is practically a gentle suggestion for the man to leave. Thus, it is quite common to hear expressions like Won't you have some cake? Won't you come with me? Won't you be so kind as to, etc.? Of course will you? is the usual form used in these sentences.

Exercise 25. Make sentences with the following:—

1. Won't you . . . ?
2. Can't you see that . . . ?
3. Don't you know that . . . ?
4. Didn't he say that . . . ?
5. Why don't you . . . ?
6. Why did you . . . ?
7. How could you . . . ?
8. Aren't you ever . . . ?
9. Didn't I tell you . . . ?
10. Didn't you see . . . ?
11. How is it that . . . ?
12. Why isn't he . . . ?
13. Couldn't you . . . ?
14. Why hasn't she . . . ?
15. Can't the letter . . . ?
16. Didn't it . . . ?

#### 3.62. The Tag-Question
The "tag-question" is found both in Chinese and English. You are fifteen years old, aren't you? is psychologically and grammatically the same as the Chinese 你十五歲,是不是? This is really a question following a statement (affirmative or negative). Psychologically, it implies that I believe more or less already that you are fifteen years old, but that I am not quite sure about it. He has arrived already, hasn't he? implies that I know already he has arrived, only I am not positive about it; it is, therefore, quite different from Has he arrived yet? Sometimes this is used as a gentle command, as Take this away, will you? Sometimes it is used sarcastically, as So you think you are going to get away with it, don't you? (you need not think you will get away so easily); or So you killed your husband quite innocently, didn't you? (I don't believe in your innocence).

Two important points, however, must be observed. (1) the auxiliary or helping verb used in the tag-question must be the same as the one used in the preceding statement. He has arrived already, isn't it? (for hasn't he?) in analogy to the Chinese 他來了,是不是? would be quite wrong. (2) If the preceding statement is affirmative, the tag-question must be in the negative, and vice versa.

Exercise 26. Put tag-questions to the following sentences:—
1. You are going to town this afternoon, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
2. They have told you about my coming, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
3. You wouldn't want to be late, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
4. You don't mind my seeing this letter, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
5. You will keep this secret, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
6. He can come by himself, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
7. She may decide for herself, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
8. You were together with him at college, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
9. He suggested this idea to you, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?
10. You are not going to publish this, . . . . . . . . . . . . ?

#### 3.63. Tonal Interrogation and the Questioning Tone
Another form of question usually expressing surprise is to keep the usual form of the affirmative or negative sentence, and give it a rising questioning tone at the end of the sentence. The president has resigned? (with rising tone) implies some surprise at the news. In other cases, it shows only an attentive or affectionate attitude. Yes? or Well? means go ahead and tell me what you are going to say. Oh, papa, you are going to buy me a sailing boat? Really? Yes? No? is a form of asking that is difficult to resist.

In English questions, the tone generally rises toward the end. Are you there? is pronounced are (low) you (highest) there (starting low and gradually rising). There are some exceptions, however. First, in questions with interrogative words, like What is it all about? the tone at the end drops as in other statements. Secondly, questions ending with an or not keep the rising tone until the last or not, when the tone drops: Will you pay me or not? Thirdly, statements followed by a tag-question have the usual dropping tone of other statements, while the tag-question itself has the regular questioning tone.

I. What do you want (drop)?
II. Do you want anything (rising)?
III. You want something (drop), don't you (rising)?
IV. Do you want something (rising) or not (drop)?

#### 3.64. The Indirect Question and Noun Clauses
Very often we want not really to ask a question, but only to state a question, as He asked me why I came late. In such indirect questions, we do not invert the order between subject and verb.

- Who are you? — I know who you are.
- Where is he? — I don't know where he is.
- Why didn't he come? — The teacher asked why he didn't come.
- What did he say? — I didn't hear what he said.
- What shall I do? — The student asked what he should do.

In this way we get many noun clauses beginning with such interrogative words as what, who, why, how, where, when. We often also use the words whether and if, as in He asked whether (if) he might join us / I wish to find out whether (if) he is still there. These noun clauses are used like single words as far as their grammar is concerned, i.e., they are treated as one noun. E.g.—

- He has done it. How he did it does not concern us.
- Whether we are going to have a good or bad government depends on ourselves entirely.
- How old she is is not for me to ask.

In Find out what is the trouble (what the trouble is), we may consider the word-order as normal (not inverted) with what as subject and is as verb. (cf Find out who is there). But a sentence like Find out how is that to be done (instead of how that is), or How old is she is not for me to ask is strictly not correct, although many English writers often make this mistake.

Rarely we find an indirect question put in the form of a direct question:—

- The servant opened the door and told me his master was out. He said the master had left word to say that he would be at the club from four to half past five this afternoon, and would I be willing to go and meet him there.

Exercise 27. Make sentences with the following phrases and noun clauses:—

1. Ask whether.
2. I don't know if.
3. I don't see how.
4. Go and see if.
5. Can't understand why.
6. He can't remember when.
7. Don't know why.
8. How or when he escaped.
9. Who has broken the window.
10. Who is in the room.
11. What that fellow's name is.
12. How long this meeting will be.
13. When the train is to arrive.
14. When the boat is leaving.
15. Whether this is true or not.
16. If the rain has stopped.
17. If dinner is ready.

### 3.70. Potential Moods
There are a class of sentences which express a command, a wish, or a conjecture, and state what may be true rather than what is true, or what the speaker wishes to be done rather than what is done. These involve the use of such helping words as may, can, must, will, shall, dare, need, ought, etc. Some of these have already been studied in the preceding sections (Affirmation, Negation and Interrogation). It is also not meant that these potential sentences are not affirmative or negative sentences. But actually there is this class of sentences which must be studied. The distinction between what is true and what may be true is quite important, and the student should avoid stating as actual fact what is only a wish or a possibility. These sentences are called "potential" in this book, because they all express what may happen or what is possible. Sometimes a Chinese student says I hope you come. He makes this mistake because he has not learnt that the form You come expresses a real act, while what he hopes for is only You will come, i.e., a potential fact.

#### 3.71. Command, Request, Suggestion, etc.
Sometimes we wish somebody to do something. This may not always be a command; it may be a humble request, a friendly advice, or a pious wish. Of course, the simplest form is the direct command, as Go and fetch water! This is always addressed to the hearer, and the word you is generally, although not always, omitted. We add the you especially when there are several persons receiving the order, as You wash the floor, and you (pointing to another) clean the window. When the persons commanded are still more numerous or different, we generally use shall, should, is to, etc. Thus, The third-year boys are to come in first and take the front rows, the second-year boys shall march in when the bell rings and the first-year boys will follow after them. When the speaker himself is involved, the usual form is let us (let's), as Let's have a game, or more gently, Let's have a game, shall we?

Actually, however, we seldom use the direct command, and prefer to put it in a milder form, even when speaking to a servant. Thus it is difficult to draw a sharp distinction between a command, a request or a gentle suggestion. We may say to a servant Will you bring me some cold water? or Will you look after the baby? Will you? and will you please? are probably the commonest forms. But even will you? is already too much like a command, when we wish to ask a doctor to come to our house: we generally say can you?, or even better (because more indirect), Could you come to my house now?

As friendly advice, the commonest form is probably you have better, or you had better (go). It is always more indirect and sounds less like a command when we use the subjunctive forms should, might, could. An extremely indirect way is to use I should, as I shouldn't reply to him at all, (if I were you).

Exercises 28. Learn to use the following phrases in sentences expressing a command, a request or an advice:—

1. will you?
2. will you please?
3. you + verb.
4. will some of you?
5. may I trouble you to?
6. would you care to?
7. can you?
8. could you?
9. you should
10. you ought to
11. the boy shall
12. you had (you'd) better (plus infinitive without to)
13. you have (you've) better
14. will you be so kind as to?
15. try to

#### 3.72. "Shall" and "Will"
The use of shall and will may cause some difficulty to some students, although this is really quite simple. The whole difficulty lies only in these two facts:

(1) I shall, We shall are used for simple future.
(2) He will, It will, You will are used also for simple future (as well as for expressing a wish).

It will rain simply means It is going to rain, with no idea of wish, and I shall be very busy simply means I am going to be very busy. Otherwise shall always expresses a command, and will always expresses a wish. Nobody will save me and I shall be drowned is the thought of a man who falls into the water, whereas Nobody shall save me; I will be drowned is a thought properly belonging to one committing a suicide. We have, then, the following scheme:—

Simple Future:
- I shall, We shall
- You will, You will
- He will, They will

Command: Always use "shall."

Wish: Always use "will."

Chinese students should learn to see I shall, we shall, shall I? more often. E.g.—

- I shall be too tired to write this evening.
- I am afraid I shall be late.
- We shall not be back for supper.
- Shall I show you how it is done?
- Shall I bring you a hot water bag?
- Shall we go and ask him?

A question with will I? will be meaningless, for we seldom need to ask ourselves if we are willing.

However, as a form of command, you will is sometimes even stronger than you shall, as You will pack out at once (= 給我滾蛋). Here you will implies I know you are going to (do as I say), and that I will not be disobeyed. Also, Englishmen often use I'll instead of I shall in many places because of economy of expression, as I'll (really I shall) not be able to go.

Exercises 29. Put will and shall in the following sentences instead of going to, want to, wish to, etc.

1. I am going to tell you everything.
2. I do not want to be disobeyed.
3. It is going to be Thursday tomorrow.
4. We are going to stay until midnight.
5. They are going to stay till morning.
6. Are we going to have plenty to eat?
7. Am I going to have my pay this week-end?
8. I told him not to go, but he wants to go.

#### 3.73. Hope and Wish
In English, there is a slight distinction between hope and wish. Generally, we hope for what may or will happen, but wish for something which is quite untrue, but which might or could be true. Thus hope is usually followed by will, may, can, while wish is followed by were, could, would or by a verb in the subjunctive past.

- I hope you will come.
- I hope you will be satisfied.
- I hope they can agree with us.
- I wish I were dead, (but I am alive).
- I wish I could help you, (but I can't).
- I wish you would not talk like that.
- Do you know who sent the letter? — I wish I knew (i.e., I don't know).
- I wish you could see him fighting against the whole bunch of them.
- I hope it isn't true.
- I wish it were true, (but it is not).

Of course in wish to and I hope to, both words are followed by the infinitive.

The English way of thinking makes a sharp distinction between what is a fact and what is a mere wish or desire. In case of a wish, we always use the verb in the infinitive, even when a past form or an added -s is usually required. Thus, we have He commanded that the witness tell (not told) everything he knew before the court, and Our wish was that he leave (not left) this city at once. So also we have God save the king! (not saves), and Long live the Republic! (not lives). Another common English way of expressing a wish is to use may in such sentences as May God bless you! and May you live to repent this! A wish for what has not happened is often expressed by an exclamation with if: If I only had more money! / If I could only see her face once more! / If I only knew!

Exercises 30. Make some sentences with the following phrases:—
1. I hope you will (can)........
2. I wish you would........
3. I wish I could........
4. I wish I had........
5. The master wishes to........
6. Let us hope that........
7. The mother hopes to........
8. If my father would........
9. If I could........
10. If I only had........

#### 3.74. Permission, Prohibition, Obligation, etc.
The English expression of allowing (permission) and not allowing (prohibition) is rather simple and similar to Chinese. Both may and can are used to express permission and prohibition, but where the idea of allowed to, not allowed to is strictly meant, we should use may and not can.

- May (Can) I go out, sir?
- May (Can) I go now?
- You may (can) go.
- You may not (=are not allowed to) tell it to others.
- Passengers may not (=are not allowed to) smoke in their cabins.
- Students may (=are allowed to) pay their tuitions in instalments.

Various ideas of obligation are expressed by must, have to, should, is to, is supposed to, is expected to and ought to. Ought (from "owe") expresses more the idea of duty, but it also often expresses a theoretical assumption (論理該當如是) or a conjecture. Following are some examples of the usage of the various words:—

- You must (not) tell him.
- Must you go now? Do you have to go?
- Must you tell him everything? (It is unnecessary and foolish to do so.)
- You should be more careful.
- You ought to tell him, (which you don't).
- Mr. Ellis ought to know, (he is an expert).
- I thought that ought to be all right, (but it turned out to be otherwise).
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself, (but you are not).
- You are not supposed to talk in class.
- He is to (=is expected to) arrive tomorrow.
- You are expected to hand in your compositions.
- You are to go and fetch him.
- He is supposed to be here already, (but he is late).
- You are not supposed to know, (but I tell you secretly).

It is an interesting thing that the idea of obligation is now more commonly expressed by the phrases is to (am to, etc.) and has to (have to, etc.), especially in the past and future tenses. We do not say He must go yesterday, but He had to go, and we never say He will must go, but He will have to go. Is to means is expected to or is supposed to, and often refers to something to be done in the future. We have then the forms:—

- Past: He had to pay. We were to meet that day.
- Present: He has to (=must) pay. We are to meet often.
- Future: He will have to pay. We are to meet this afternoon.

The Prince was to visit the Capital on the 12th means that at that time the Prince had not yet visited the city, but it had been arranged for him to do so on the 12th.

Exercise 31. Make a few sentences using had to, has to, will have to, are supposed to, is expected to, ought to, was to, were to, is to. Make some sentence with must and change it into the past or future tense, and see how you will have to change the expression.

#### 3.75. Conjecture and Possibility
May, can and must are also used in a different sense, that of conjecture. Suppose something has been lost, we may hear the following conjectures about the thief:—

- Who can it be?
- It cannot be Mr. Y——, for he was not in the room.
- Can it be the cook?
- It may be the cook's nephew who was here alone.
- It may be he, or it may be a burglar.
- No, it cannot be the cook or his nephew, and there were no burglars here. It must be the policeman.

Thus we have the three forms, can it be? (with it cannot be), it may be and it must be. Compare in this connexion the use of hwei (=can), in Chinese in 會不會是他? and i-ting (=must) in 一定是巡警. Must is very often used in this sense. E.g.—

- You must be very hungry now.
- He must be dying now.
- That must be the real reason why he came here.
- If C— is your father's class-mate, he must be well over forty now.
- I will go and take his place. He must be getting tired now.
- I think they must be brother and sister, for they look very much alike.
- We didn't wait for you long. I knew something must have kept you.

The expressions "possibility" and "probability" are quite new to the Chinese language, as we can see from the new expression "～之可能," ("probability" remains untranslatable yet). It is important, however, that the student of English learn early to use such expressions.

Exercise 32. (I) Make sentences with the following phrases:—
- It may or it may not be...............
- You may or may not..................
- It is possible that....................
- It is probable that...................
- Probably. Possibly.
- The people are likely to..............

(II) Discuss the possible reason why some one is absent from class, using the phrases Can it be that? It may be that, It must be because.

(III) Use must in some sentence in the sense of a conjecture.

#### 3.76. Pure Supposition: Would, Should, Could, Might
The words would, should, could, might are supposed to be the past forms of will, shall, can and may. But in reality they express an entirely different class of notions. If you put your finger in the fire, what would happen? Your finger would get burnt, wouldn't it? This is true at any time. We may, therefore, call such a statement a general supposition.

Whenever we think of a thing as a general or pure supposition, we use might, should, could and would. He can do it means definitely that he can (a fact), but He could do it means I suppose that he can do it, although he has not done it. China is not strong, but China could be strong, if, etc. You have not burnt down the whole house this time, but you might have, so next time be more careful. All these express pure suppositions and not facts. A supposition could, of course, be true. If I say "Mr. P— may be sick," I am stating it as a possible fact. But if I say "Mr. P— might be sick, for I haven't seen him for the last few days," I am stating a pure supposition of mine. The difference between may and might, therefore, chiefly depends, not on the facts of the situation, but on the intention of the speaker.

This distinction between fact and fancy (see fuller treatment in Chapter XIV) is very important to learn, because there is nothing like it in Chinese grammar. Many Chinese students fail to learn the use of such highly idiomatic expressions as I should think, I should like, would you? could you? etc. because they do not know the idea of general supposition or pure supposition. And yet the proper use of I should like, could you? etc. is one of the first conditions of speaking good English. Simple people like to make blunt statements of facts, whereas more educated people are never too sure about what they do not quite know. It is often more refined to say "It would be all right" than to say "It is all right." Could you come to my house? is also more polite and gentle than Can you, etc.? because it seems to say Could you come, if I should ask you? as a matter of supposition. It is less direct than asking Can you come or can you not? as a question of fact.

- What will you do now? (What are you going to do?)—A question of fact.
- What would you do, (if you were in my place)?—A supposition.
- Can you do it? (Are you able to do it)?—A fact.
- Could you do it, (if I should ask you)?—A supposition.
- Suppose you put water over the fire, what would happen? Would the fire get wet?
- Suppose you put oil into the fire, what would happen? You might burn down the whole house, might you not?
- Look out! you may fall down. Answer: But I don't (fall down). Reply: But you might.
- I should like to see you try. (I suppose I like.)
- I should think he feels rather ashamed of it.
- Would you have tea or coffee? What would you rather have, tea or coffee? (Gentle question.)
- Why don't you do it? Answer: I suppose I could do it, but I don't want to.
- Will you help him? He is short of money. Answer: I would if I could (but the fact is, I can't).
- You should help him if you could. And I believe you could if you would. (You will not, that's why you say you can't).

#### 3.77. The Subjunctive Clause
We often use the word if to express a condition, as if it rains, if he comes, etc. Just as there is a difference between can you come? and could you come?, so there is a difference between if he comes and if he should come.

- Tell him to wait if he comes. (It is quite possible that he will come.)
- Tell him I am not at home, if he should come. (He seldom comes, and I don't wish to see him.)
- If he is there, tell him to come at once. (He may be there.)
- If he should be there again, bring him to me. (He has been there once, and I have told him not to go there again, but if he should do so, bring him to me.)
- If I am elected, send me a telegram.
- If I were (should be) you, I would resign at once.

So much, then, depends on what the speaker means, whether he considers it as a possible fact or as a pure supposition. The forms, if...is, if...comes, etc., are thus used for more likely suppositions, while the form if...should is used for more theoretical suppositions. There are, besides, the forms if he come (not comes), if you be (not are) in which the verbs are said to be in the subjunctive mood; their meaning is the same as if he should come, if you should be. And then, when a supposition is known to be untrue, we even use the past form of the verb, as if I knew, if I were (i.e., I don't know and I am not). We have, then, the following:—

1. If he comes.
2. If he come.
3. If he should come.
4. Should he come.
5. If he came.

- If I am.
- If I be.
- If I should be.
- Should I be.
- If I were.

The forms "2" to "4" are really identical in meaning. For a more detailed study of the changes in verbs (if he had come, etc.), see Chapters XIII and XIV.

It is peculiar to English that we could use the if-clause at the end of a sentence. Up till a few years ago when we started this "Europeanized Chinese" (語體歐化) business, we could not do so in a Chinese sentence. Now we can say, for instance, 此人野心很大, 倘是我的推料不錯 ("This man has great personal ambition, if I am not mistaken in my judgment"). This comes with the colloquial style. The if-clause comes as an after-thought; it is more easy and familiar and more like our thinking, because we often do not think of the if-clause until the end of the statement.

Exercise 33. Should is very often used after if. Make a number of sentences with the if...should construction. Generally, when this is used, we also use would in the other part of the sentence.

### 3.80. Emotional Utterances
All words have an emotional power, and the power varies with the speaker, the person spoken to, the situation and tone in which it is spoken, etc. Oh, Johnny! from a loving wife after a six months' absence may say a thousand things beyond the power of the most finished public speaker, and at times, it may reform a drunkard where a Salvation Army man has failed with his volumes of eloquence. Emotional utterances, therefore, have a value which has nothing to do with the length of the sentence or its grammatical perfection. They are usually short, to the point, and present many grammatical peculiarities.

In the hour of excitement, we generally say the few words that are uppermost in our minds. Oh! / Ah! / Amen! / Well! / What? are such common expressions. The soldier in the trench seeing the coming of the deadly poison gas and wishing to give his fellow-soldiers warning, can only shout Gas! Gas! Other exclamations with one noun are: An iceberg! / A whale! / A shark! / Hot cross buns! / The police! / The proctor! / A great idea! / My pistol! Exclamations of verbs without subjects are: Forward march! / Halt! / Shoot! / Raining! and of subjects with the verb omitted are: Well, I never! (heard of or saw such a thing) / He dead? Still others may express an adjective or an adverb alone, as How silly! / Excellent! / Fine! / Gorgeous! / Marvellous! / Now! / Never again! Others may express a situation or a short phrase, as A man in the water! / The pity of it! / One a penny! Some exclamations may by mere sounds, like Tut! / Pshaw! / La, la! / Hurrah! / Whoop! / Z—z—z—z—z, etc.

Some special grammatical forms used in exclamations may be noticed here: those beginning with that, to, if, and those with interrogative words (without change of subject-verb word-order):—

(1) That you, too, should turn against me!
Oh, God! that bread should be so dear,
And flesh and blood so cheap!

(2) To think that I shall never see you again!
To think you could be so ungrateful!

(3) If the rain would only stop!
If I could go to see him now!

(4) How beautiful! How beautiful that is!
What fun! What happiness!
What a sight! What a poet!
What to do? What to say?

#### 3.81. Swear-Words
English people swear as much as Chinese do, although they swear differently. Swear-words often express meanings which cannot be as forcefully conveyed by other means. An English Major-General swearing at his soldiers with "You pack of consumptive little Maltese monkeys!" generally gets himself obeyed. To call a man "a dirty dog" or a woman "a cat" (spiteful woman) may save us the trouble of using many long adjectives. The important thing to observe is to swear at the right person and in the right atmosphere.

Swearing could be very vulgar, although, in Chinese, vulgar swearing is indulged in by our perfectly respectable uncles and aunts. An English student, however, should learn at least some effective and comparatively respectable forms of swearing. Some convenient and not too mild swear-words are: Bother! Botheration! Dash it! The cursed ——! You blasted fool! I'm bloomed (damned) if I know! That blessed son of yours! By (St.) George! and By Jove! (Jupiter) are quite inoffensive to Christian ears, as also Ye gods! and Great Heavens! Ladies may use milder forms like Dear me! Oh dear! Oh my! My goodness! or Good gracious! The word damned (a damned thing, damn it!) with its slang form darned should generally be avoided before the ladies, although it may be quite the thing in certain classes of society, and although St. Paul used it frequently in the Bible. In very familiar circles, sometimes a little liberty with the popular damned may be allowed. As a substitute for damn, we may use dash, and as a substitute for bloody (bloody nuisance, all bloody fine, bloody quick) we may use blessed (not a blessed cent, but awful nuisance, awfully good).

The taboo on swear-words varies from time to time and according to people's changing beliefs. Now that people's fear of hell-fire is disappearing, it is quite all right to use "To the hell with ——!" because it no longer hurts. Swearing by God is generally not allowed, although the longest example of this form of swearing is to be found in the Roman Catholic official curse or anathema used in excommunicating people from the church.
