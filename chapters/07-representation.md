## CHAPTER VII: REPRESENTATION

### 7.10. Representation

When we say “John speaks to John’s mother, but John’s mother does not hear John,” everybody feels that the statement is unnecessarily long and awkward. Usually we say “John speaks to his mother, but she does not hear him.” The words his, she and him represent, or take the place of, John’s, John’s mother and John. Hence it is often said that pronn. are words which take the place of nn. This is quite true, but it should be remembered that, like all other definitions, this definition should not be taken too seriously. The word mother in John’s mother can be said to take the place of, or represent, Mrs. X, and yet it is not considered a pron., but a n.

What is more important for the student of grammar to remember is that here we are dealing with a general problem of representation. We use she to represent Mrs. X, because there is a need for economy in speech. There are various reasons for using representation: for economy, variation, expressiveness, and for social reasons. But this is not confined to pronn. When we say “He forgot to take the cover off, although I told him to” (for “to take the cover off”), we are purposely avoiding repetition and aiming at economy just as in using the pron. she for Mrs. X.

On the other hand, when we purposely avoid saying “I believe” and use “we believe” or “the present writer believes” instead, we do not achieve economy, but are satisfying a need for modesty. When a Chinese mother refers to her husband not by mentioning his name, but as “So-and-so’s father” or as the very ambiguous “he,” she is also using a form of representation out of shyness. Finally, when a newspaper editor writes “A certain general is reported to have sent a large consignment of a certain commodity to Shanghai,” instead of writing more bluntly “General Y— has sent a consignment of opium,” he is using representation to avoid going into gaol.

The pronn. are, of course, the most important class of words used for representation. In this chapter, we shall study not only the forms of pronn. but also the purposes for which representation is used. We shall also study various means of representation besides the pronn., such as the use of metaphors, indirect statements and representation by omission.

### Personal Pronouns

### 7.20. Personal Pronouns: Case and Person

When we speak of pronn., we always think of the words I, you, he, she, it, we, they. These are called “personal pronouns” and they form the most important class. There are also impersonal and other pronn. which we shall study later. All these personal pronn. except it, refer to persons, and the words who may also be included here.

These pronn. are said to belong to three persons and three cases. In the following tables, the old or archaic forms are put in brackets.

|          | Singular     | Plural |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| First Person  | I            | we     |
| Second Person | you (thou)   | you    |
| Third Person  | he, she, it  | they   |

The words I, you, he, etc. used as subjects of vbb. are said to be in the “nominative case”; the words my, your, his, etc. are said to be in the “possessive case”; and the words me, you, him, etc. used as objects of vbb. (see me) or of prepp. (for me) are said to be in the “objective case.”

| Nominative | I      | (thou) | he   | she  | it   | we   | you  | they | who  |
|------------|--------|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Possessive | my     | (thy)  | his  | her  | its  | our  | your | their| whose|
| Objective  | me     | (thee) | him  | her  | it   | us   | you  | them | whom |

The peculiar thing about the pronn. in the objective case is that they are usually unaccented and are joined to the preceding vbb. or prepp. in pronunciation as if they were syllables of the same word. Thus—

Don’t believe it [biˈliːvɪt].
Don’t tell them [ˈtelðəm, ˈteləm].
I can’t see him [ˈsiːhɪm, ˈsiːɪm, ˈsiːm].
Was glad to meet her [ˈmiː tə] (pr. just like meter).
No use denying it [diˈnaɪiŋɪt].
in it [ˈinit], above it [əˈbavɪt].
once upon a time [ˈwʌnsəpɒnəˈtaɪm].
at home [ætˈhəʊm, or: əˈtəʊm], at it [ætit, or: əˈtɪt].
to him [ˈtuː(ː)ɪm], to me [ˈtuːmiː].
for us [ˈfɔːrəs, ˈfɔːrəs; or: ˈfɔːr-].

Chinese students usually say “tell them,” “see him”— which is all wrong. Only when these words are emphasized do we accept them, as “for me, not for you.”

### 7.21. Mine, Thine, etc.

Study the following:—

This is my book.                          It is mine.
This is her ring.                         The ring is hers.
You bring your book.                      They will bring theirs.
It is my pleasure.                        The pleasure is mine.
It is your fault.                         The fault is yours.

Notice when the nn. used after my, thy, etc. are understood, we change the pronn. into mine, thine, etc. Thus we have the following series, with the exception of its.

my—mine                                  our—ours
thy—thine                                your—yours
his—his                                  their—theirs
her—hers                                 whose—whose

A very peculiar use is seen in the following:—

Our friend.                               A friend of ours.
My pen.                                   This pen of mine.
Their relative.                           A relative of theirs.
Jimmy’s (his) brother.                    A brother of Jimmy’s (his).
Your boy-husband.                         That boy-husband of yours.
Your filial son.                          That filial son of yours.
Her uncle’s book.                         That book of her uncle’s.

There is always a tinge of familiarity implied in such expressions. Notice that we cannot say that your son or this my pen, but must say that son of yours or this pen of mine (cf. § 8.30).

Exercise 45. Put in the words mine, thine, etc. and omit the nn. wherever you can in the following sentences 1-5, and use a ... of yours, that ... of mine, etc. in the sentences 6-10.

1. I will give you my book, and you will give me your book.
2. My mother is older than her mother.
3. He forgot to bring his dictionary. I have not forgot my dictionary.
4. It is both your fault and his fault.
5. Here is a handkerchief. Whose handkerchief is it?
6. That son you have is up for mischief.
7. He is my father's darling friend.
8. That is his pet notion.
9. That is one of my bad habits.
10. It has been my fond dream to visit Europe.

### 7.22. Influence of Modesty, Respect, Familiarity, etc.

As we have said already, pronn. are used for different purposes of representation. Pronn. are changed also, therefore, when the purpose is changed.

Out of modesty, real or assumed, we often try to avoid using too many “I’s,” especially in writing, and substitute for them the vaguer “we,” as in we believe, we have often seen, if we are to believe his words, if we are not mistaken. This is so especially in writing. Sometimes the present writer is used instead, as in It has come to the present writer’s knowledge, etc. for “my knowledge.” In official signed statements, the undersigned (sing. or pl.) is often used with vbb in the third person (The undersigned is, or are, of the opinion, etc.). Compare Chinese 鄙人, 愚, 愚見, etc. instead of 我, 吾意. This, of course, is always formal and may seem at times affected and unnatural. Compare also the “modest” use of one (§ 7.24, “c”).

On the other hand, respect or deference to a superior or stranger often compels us to avoid the direct “you.” Compare Chinese 楊先生, 煥章先生, 尊意 and the Pekingnese 您 instead of 你, 汝意. The English you can be used in addressing superiors and strangers quite generally, where Chinese would avoid it by saying “Mr. Yang,” ‘Miss Chen” (楊先生, 陳女士, 煥章先生), etc.

Study also the following expressions:—

I object, your Honour (to judge).
Your Majesty (to king, queen, emperor). Also in the third person His Majesty the King, Her Majesty the Queen, Their Majesties the King & Queen, whence H. B. M. (His or Her Britannic Majesty), H. M. S. (His Majesty’s ship).
Your (His, Her) Royal Highness (to princes, etc.).
Your Excellency (to ambassadors, governors & their wives).
Hence “the late H. E. Wu Ting-fang.” It is His Excellency’s desire, etc.
Received an order from yourself, or your good self (only in commercial letters).

Familiarity, on the other hand, causes us to use the plain, natural “I” and the blunt “you,” and it is good for a man to be able to speak and write naturally. In the “familiar style” of essays and in personal letters, we write as if we are speaking to intimate friends in our unbuttoned moods, and this way of writing has a charm of its own. That is also why the humorists usually use the plain I and you (I believe, I met, I know, I doubt, I can’t understand, you know jolly well, you will never understand, not if you die in the attempt, etc.)

Then there are various other factors, social or psychological. A modern Chinese young lady sometimes refers to her father as “papa” even when speaking to people not her relatives, perhaps out of a desire to appear dainty. In all households with children, the terms “mother,” “mammy,” “daddy,” “uncle,” “auntie” invariably supplant other ways of reference, so that the husband would often refer to his wife as “mother” (How is mother? / Where’s daddy?). Study also the following:—

Damn it, kid, I love you! (among sweethearts)
But, my dear sir, this is not so simple (sarcastic, familiar). Also, in the same sense: my good sir, my dear fellow, my good man, my good woman (cf. 老兄啊!).
How is my baby? (to sweethearts and wives)
Don’t let the old man know (referring to father or husband).
What does your old man (woman) say? (husband or wife)
But yours truly will not be there (slang for I).
What can a fellow do? (for What can I do?)
Ask my Mrs. She knows all about it. How is your Mrs.? (common familiar term for wife)

It is quite all right in English to speak of “my wife,” “my husband” as a common term of reference.

Special mention should be made of the royal we and the editorial we. The first is used by kings and queens in proclamations and official statements (“It has our approval,” “We feel better today”). The second is used by the newspaper editor in his leaders (“We do not think it fit to publish the said letters”). In both cases it is based on the idea of collective responsibility.

### 7.23. Reflexive and Reciprocal Pronouns

Besides the regular pronn., there are the self-pronn. in English:—

myself ………………ourselves
thyself ………………yourself, yourselves
himself }
herself } ………………themselves
itself }
oneself, or one’s self

Ourself (singular) is seldom used except in connexion with the “royal we” (§ 7.22). Yourself is the sing. of yourselves. In general, these self-pronn. have two uses, one to show reflexive or reflected action, and the other to show emphasis. Examples of reflexive action are:—

He killed himself.                     Don’t starve yourself.
Understand yourself.                   If you do, you have only yourself to blame.
Protect yourself.                      Gave herself a holiday
Amused oneself with novels.            Deceive oneself.
Believed himself to be a genius        Give oneself airs.
Got themselves into trouble.           Rest yourself.
Made oneself a nuisance.               System lends itself to abuse.
Dragged himself from bed.              Magazine pays for itself.
                                       Tomorrow will take care of itself.

Examples of the use for emphasis are:—

She herself said it.                   You yourself told me.
You yourself did it.                   They themselves are to blame.
I myself saw it.                       Even the king himself didn’t know.
I saw it myself.                       We ourselves would do the same on like occasions.
Ask the lady herself.                  Tell him yourself.

In the above examples, the self-pronn. are used to reinforce the meaning of the preceding pronn. and are used in apposition to them. It is possible to use them alone without preceding pronn:—

Ask herself.                           What ourselves would do is none of your business.
It was myself.                         My wife is the same age as myself.
Ourselves are to blame.

But it would not be very nice to say Myself saw it, Himself went there. There are also such uses as for themselves, (the thing) in itself, (They sat) by themselves, and your own self.

There are two compound pron. each other and one another, which indicate reciprocal action. Examples of their use are:—

Do you know each other?                    Copy sentences for each other.
Ask each other questions.                   Tear each other's hair.
Change dresses with one another.            Look into each other's face.
Tell one another stories.                   Each looks into the other's face.
Share one another's money.                  They hate each other.
Share money with one another.               Each hates the other.

Each other and one another are now used in the same way. The distinction between each other for two persons and one another for more than two is neither necessary, nor useful, nor historically sound.

Exercise 26. (1) Make some sentences using the self-pron. in the emphatic sense (I myself, you yourself, etc.).

(2) Make some sentences showing reciprocal action, with vbb. like help, fight, cheat, dislike, quarrel, make peace with, trade with, salute, suspect, trust, recognize, know, despise, etc. Also the material in the above examples may be freely drawn upon.

### 7.24. General Person: “One,” “People,” etc.

We often say “one may think,” “people may think” with reference to a vague general person or society in general. This is really neither in the first, nor in the second, nor in the third person, because it really includes all three. There are various ways of expressing this abstract general person in English. Study this:—

People may think you crazy.
They may think you crazy.
One may think you crazy.

To hear you talk like that, one would think you are crazy.
On looking over the statement carefully, one is tempted to think that you are paid to sing praises of the Board.

One will have to be more careful in speech, if one values one’s life.
You will have to be more careful in speech, if you value your lives.
We shall have to be more careful in speech, if we value our lives.

We and you here are really used to denote general person. In this sense, you is used only in a very familiar style.

The use of one requires special attention. Two meanings may be distinguished here:—

(a) One hates his enemies and another forgives them.
(b) One hates one’s enemies and loves one’s friends.

In the first example, one is really the short form for one man. In the second example, it denotes general person and means the same thing as people. In this second sense, it is better to use one’s, oneself, one in the rest of the sentence instead of his, himself, he, him (“One knows one’s, not his, own weakness”), although in America and with some British writers, the use of he, his after one is quite common. There is a third use for one, and that is as a “modest” substitute for I:—

(c) After reading this, one gets a confused feeling about the whole affair (= I get, etc.)
On inquiring further, one was told, etc. (= I was told, etc.)

The mixture of one, I, we, you, people for the same person in the same sentence is in any case bad English.

Exercise 47. (I) Find out in the following whether the one used denotes a general person or some particular one person or thing, or is really a substitute for I:—

1. I saw one on the floor and picked it up.
2. One came in and was followed by another.
3. One cannot always spend money on others: he (preferably one) must also plan for his (preferably one’s) own future.
4. He spoke so eloquently that one was inclined to believe him.
5. He asked me for help. Could one refuse in such circumstances?

(II) Correct the following mixed use of one, I, we, you, people:—
6. The use of “one” is rather new to you, so one has to be careful.
7. If one looks into the minutes of the meeting, you will be surprised how much time was wasted in useless discussion.
8. We would have gone on infinitely, had one had time to do so.
9. One must be patient, if we want to succeed.
10. People always criticize the older generation, and when they grow old, you do the same.

### 7.30. Conflict of Person

We have seen already in § 5.40 that sometimes there is a conflict in number. Sometimes there can be also a highly inconvenient conflict in person, or in both person and number. Thus, (1) shall we say “He or I am (is?) to blame,” “Neither I nor you are (am?) allowed to speak”? Here grammarians cannot agree on any single rule, and the fact is, there is no rule in usage. One way is to follow the force of attraction, i.e., follow the nearest pron., thus: “He or I am to blame” but “I or he is to blame,” and “Are you or I next?” but “Am I or you next?” A better way is to avoid such constructions by saying “He or I should be blamed,” or “Either he is to blame, or I am to blame.” This second way is always possible in writing, and is to be recommended.

(2) When there is a conflict of number, and when one of the subjects is plural, or when two subjects form a plural number, then use the plural vb.

Either he or his brothers fail in their duty.
You and I are out of danger now.
I and he were on the same train.
I hear you and he are cousins.

(3) There is another source of trouble from such constructions as some of us, some of you, etc. Here commonsense may be trusted to decide on the right word to use. Study the following:—

Some of us think they (not we) can fight without my leadership. (Not including speaker.)
Some of us think we (not they) can conquer by passive resistance. (Including speaker.)
Some of you believe they can make more money that way.
Most of us lost our heads (if including speaker), or Most of us lost their heads (if the speaker thinks he is an exception).

(4) But our troubles do not end here. We have the relative pron. who. Who always agrees with its related preceding word (“antecedent”) in person and number. Study the following:—

Don’t choose me, who am already burdened with too much work.
It is not you who are in trouble, it is I who am in trouble.
I am not one who is (not am) afraid of criticism.
I am not one who cares.
You are the one who was (not were) elected.

Exercise 48. (I) Make sentences with the phrases:—

1. I who am
2. You who are
3. He who is
4. We who are
5. He who has
6. They who have
7. He who knows
8. We who know

(II) Decide which word should be used in the following:—

1. It is not he who have (has?) cheated you. It is you who have (has?) cheated him.
2. You are the man who break (breaks?) his promise.
3. Are you he who were (was?) here some time ago?
4. Either he or you is (are?) wrong. (change in any way you like.)
5. I hear you and he are (is?) good friends.
6. You who . . . so strong — you ought to be ashamed of yourself beating him who . . . a mere child.

### 7.31. Conflict of Case: “Who” and “Whom”

Here are three types of cases to be discussed: (a) the it-is-I type, (b) the use of who and whom, and (c) the use of whoever, whomever.

(1) In “It is I,” “It is he,” the pron. I and he are not the objects of is in meaning. Hence the use of the nominative case. So also—

It was not I.
Then who (not whom) is it?
If anybody is to be punished, it should be he (not him).
Is this she (not her) whom I am going to marry?

(2) Who : whom. The use of the relative pron. who or whom has nothing to do with its antecedent, but depends entirely on its relation inside the who-clause (marked off in parentheses).

He deserted me (who gave him his chance in life). [Subj. of gave]
His mother is the person (who loves him best). [She loves him best]
His mother is the person (whom he loves best). [He loves her best]
Don’t argue with me (who am trying to help you). [Subj. of am]

We have to use different words when the cases are different, as in the following:—

His name is Alfonso, who is their king and whom they are trying to overthrow.
Hackett was her husband, who often maltreated her, and whom she hated like poison.

Sometimes this is confused by the introduction of an independent clause, like I think, they suppose, but the rule remains unchanged. Compare the following:—

Then came Mr. Dobson, who (not whom) we knew was a grocer. We knew he (not him) was a grocer.
Then came Mr. Dobson, whom they knew to be a grocer. They knew him to be a grocer.
He met the girl whom he recognized to be his childhood friend. He recognized her (not she) to be his childhood friend.
News came from Captain Johnson, who, they had thought, was dead. He, they had thought, was dead.
News came from Captain Johnson, whom they had regarded as dead. They had regarded him as dead.

Notice also the following:—

I don’t know (who did it).
We will decide (who is to go first).

The whole who-clauses are the objects of know and decide, and therefore we do not say whom. Again, the use of who or whom depends on the relation inside the clause.

(3) Whoever : whomever. Like who and whom, the use of whoever or whomever also depends on its relation inside the clause entirely. “Whoever” simply means “any person who” and “whomever” means “any person whom.”

Whoever says so is a liar or a knave. (Any person who says so, etc.)
Whoever comes is welcome. (Any one who comes, etc.)
Whomever they met was asked to contribute a few dollars. (Any person whom they met, etc.)
I will marry whoever comes first my way. (I will marry any one who comes, etc.)
They stopped whomsoever they saw. (They stopped any person whom they saw.)
For whomever he met he had a nod. (For any one whom he met, etc.)
For whoever met him he had a nod. (For any one who met him, etc.)

Thus our general conclusion is as follows:—

| Person and Number | Case |
|-------------------|------|
| Agrees with what goes before: I who am, you who are, etc. | WHO | Is determined by what follows: who knows, whom they know, etc. |

Exercise 49. Decide whether who or whom should be used in the following, and show why:—

1. The question regarding who(m) was to blame for the Great War is not so simple as the ignorant people imagine.
2. She kept the secret from him who(m) ought to know everything.
3. It was not he who(m) she was afraid of, but his lawyer.
4. It was not he who(m) was afraid of her, but she who(m) was afraid of him.
5. You need not be afraid of him who(m) you know is a perfect gentleman.
6. She was the girl who(m) I met yesterday.
7. He is a man who(m) they detest.
8. To those who(m) have, more shall be given.
9. He likes those who(m) flatter him and hates those with who(m) he does not agree.
10. He likes those who(m) agree with him.

### 7.40. Thing-Pronouns

So far we have been dealing with personal pronn. There are, however, pronn. for things, as well as pronn. for persons. Following are the common pronn. for things in English:—

all         none        that        these       such
some        most        this        one         former (前者)
any         what        those       which       latter (後者)

For lack of a better term, we may call these “impersonal pronouns” or “thing-pronouns.” It should be remembered, however, that most of these thing-pronn. can refer to both persons and things, and that, on the other hand, the “personal pron.” it does not usually refer to persons. The important point is that representation of thing-words is expressed by means of these pronn.

It can be easily seen that almost all these words are originally adjj: from I like those apples to I like those. Study the following:—

ADJECTIVES                          PRONOUNS
Which boy?...........................Which is which?
Which way?...........................Don’t know which.
Any new student......................Haven’t seen any.
All things............................Don’t take all.
Some food............................Please take some.
What thing?..........................What is it?

It will be noticed also that, with the exception of this, that (pl. these, those) and one (pl. ones), all these words can be either in the singular or in the plural.

None is, or are, there.
There is, or are, none left.
What is the reason? What are the reasons?
A thing that makes you sick. Things that make you sick.
All is lost. All are found.
Some of it is, some of them are, rotten. (Cf. §5.41 “e”)

### 7.41. Some, Any, None

Some is used in questions and affirmative statements. Any is used in questions and negative statements.

Do you have some?           Do you have any?
I have some.                I haven't any. I have none.
Can some (one) tell me?     Can any (one) tell me?
Some can tell me.           None can tell me.

Exercise 50. Fill the blanks with the proper words (some, any, none):—

1. There are.........
2. Are there........?
3. May I have........?
4. I don't want........
5. Give him........
6. Don't give him........
7. You haven't seen all, but you have seen........
8. No, I haven't seen........
9. Haven't you seen........?

### 7.42. What

What (=that which) is a very useful word expressing the idea represented by the Chinese so (所). What he knows is this=他所知道是這樣. See if you can use the following phrases in sentences:—

what one knows                 what is useful, useless
what one can see               what is true, false
what I am afraid of            what he said
what you do in a day           what you heard
what the government wants      what they saw
what you pay for               what frightens him
what makes me hate him         what woman wants
what everybody knows           what to say, think, do

As what means that which and already contains the antecedent in itself, we cannot say all what, but should say all that. But what is chiefly colloquial: in literary use, generally but that is used.

That is all he knows, or That is all that he knows (not all what he knows).
All one can do is to wait, or All that one can do (not all what one can do) is to wait.
Who knows but that (but what) he may have purposely told you a lie?
Who can tell but that (but what) he may be the most important man in the country three months hence?

### 7.43. One, Thing, Affair, Something, etc.

The use of one representing persons has already been discussed in the above (§7.24). Thing and affair are not usually considered as pronn., but the fact remains that these words are most commonly used in English to represent almost any kind of things. Study the following:—

Such a nice one (referring to dress, hat, Christmas tree, apple, etc.).
Give him a good one (punch him hard, pitch a baseball).
That's a good one (a good joke, retort, etc.).
A short life and a merry one.
Select the best ones. Throw away the bad ones.
He started the next revolution, if it may be called one.
Stay at any one of the dozen families you know in town.
The ones (photographs) you saw.
Open the drawer on the left, the one with a key in it.
He writes many poems, but publishes only the ones he likes.
The top one. The lower one. Little ones. A new one. Two old ones. Such a one.
(For persons) The lucky ones. The young ones. One so fair and beautiful. Like one weary of life. Like one in a dream. Like one risen from the grave. Offending one so powerful. Marry one worthy of you. One who talks. One who dares.
I don't know a thing about it.
I don't understand the whole thing.
The thing, or affair (perhaps a performance, a party, a dinner, a match, or a wedding), was a complete failure.
That's the thing (the thing we want, the right thing to give or to do, etc.).
Things (or Affairs) are better now (general conditions are better).
Take off your things (outdoor clothes, hat, etc.).
The great thing is to make a right start.
Blue socks are now the thing (the fashion).
(Referring to persons) That thing Jones. She, poor thing, never heard of it. A dear, old thing (man, woman or animal).
What is the latest thing (news)?
His death is a good thing.
I haven't a thing to say.

Something new.                      Anything you say.
Something useful.                   Anything you ask.
Something easy.                     Anything I do.
Nothing strange.                    Something to do.
Nothing new.                        Something to live for.
Nothing difficult.                  Something to read.
Anything sweet.                     Something to think about.
Anything above five feet.           Nothing to see.
Anything you want.                  Anything to eat.

Exercise 51. Make sentences with the words and phrases one, the one, like one, a thing, the thing, things, something, nothing, anything, etc., using the above examples as models.

### 7.44. That

Like the words thing and affair, the word that is often used to represent a fact, a statement, a general situation, or something we have vaguely in mind.

That is the trouble. (Something we have just mentioned is the trouble.)
When was that? (When did the thing happen?)
That was long ago. (An old event or situation.)
Oh, is that what you mean? (Is what you have just said your real meaning?)
Who was that? (Who was the person at the door?)
So that is that. (A common formula for closing one point of a discussion.)
Now, that's a good boy. (Form of coaxing children = 乖乖的.)
I know all that. All that is a waste of your time. All that is mere propaganda.

Of special interest is the use illustrated below:—

You have better break his friendship, and that (=break it) at once.
We have to pay him a monthly bribe, and that (=pay the bribe) always promptly and in full.

Much more common and important is the following use:—

The climate here is like that (=the climate) of France (not like France).
He has a head like that (=the head) of an ox, and eyes like those of a field mouse.
Her wedding took place at the same time with that (=the wedding) of her sister.

Exercise 52. Correct or improve the following sentences:—

1. His voice sounds like his brother.
2. Her name resembles her aunt.
3. This has a smell like banana.
4. Her handwriting is neat and small, while Po-liang is big and slovenly.
5. We usually value our own money, and think little of other people’s money.
6. We usually like our own composition and fail to appreciate others.
7. Everybody thinks his own wife is not so attractive as somebody else’s wife.

### 7.45. It

The word it also often stands for a vague something. What it stands for is vague enough, when used as the subject of impersonal vbb., but still vaguer, when used as an object.

AS VAGUE SUBJECT
It rains. It is cold. It was hot.
It is winter. It was getting dark.
It is six miles to Oxford.
It is too late now.
It says ‘keep to the left.’
It says in the Bible that all men are liars.

AS VAGUER OBJECT
You must fight it out (make no compromise).
The deuce take it! (a form of cursing).
Won’t stand it any longer (stand the treatment, etc.).
Give it him hot (strike him hard).
Now you have done it (you have spoiled the thing, or committed the mistake to avoid).
Shall we walk it or cab it (take a carriage)?
You can’t get away with it (you will be punished for this).
He hasn’t got it in him (the required talent).

AS COMPLEMENT MODIFIER
Yes, that’s it (just what I mean, or just the truth).
For barefaced lying, you are really It (here with special meaning=the limit, the ideal).
In a lilac sun-bonnet, she was It (=the ideal woman in ideal dress we all have been dreaming about).

It, moreover, has a very important function in the English language, (a) by helping to dispose of the vb. of a long subject first, and (b) by helping to transpose the logically important word to the first part of the sentence.

AS APPOSITIVE SUBSTITUTE OF LOGICAL SUBJECT
It is a nuisance, this delay.             This delay is a nuisance.
It is quite true, all that you say.        All that you say is quite true.
It is true that he died                  That he died is true.
It is a pity that you didn’t see it.      That you didn’t see it is a pity.

AS ANTECEDENT OF "THAT"

I don't like the colour.
The noise frightened him.
I didn't object.
We didn't start the fight.
You don't buy a fountain-pen for its looks.
What the patient needs is better food and more sunshine.
What he is after now is fame.

It is the colour that I don't like.
It was the noise that frightened him.
It was he that raised the objection.
It was the Japanese that started the fighting.
It is service that you want.
It is better food and more sunshine that the patient needs.
It is fame that he is after now.

Here the combination it . . . that is really equal to what, with the advantage of disposing of the vb. is at the very beginning.

Exercise 53. (I) Turn these long-winded sentences about, and make them neater by using it and putting the vb. immediately after it.

1. That you know the accent of every new English word is important.
2. To feed, clothe and educate the children and keep them clean, to see that the food is always healthy and nourishing, the floor and windows are kept clean, and the carpet is properly beaten, to direct and supervise the servants and prevent their quarrelling, and at the same time to look beautiful and cheerful to one's husband — all this is no easy task for a mother.
3. That you know thoroughly what you have learnt before proceeding to learn something else is advisable.
4. To learn so many subjects at the same time is a little too much for the child.

(II) Transpose the logically important element of the sentence to the first part by using it:—

1. What annoys me is the constant repetition.
2. He is not marrying her for love. He is after her money
3. The thing that impressed people most was Gandhi's mental calm.
4. What makes me angry is not the content but the tone of the letter.
5. What annoyed me was that constant monkeying with her lips with a lip-stick.

(III) Make sentences with the following phrases:—

1. It is true that……
2. It is natural that……
3. It would be unfair to……
4. It is not right that……
5. It is impossible for……to……
6. It is not enough that you……
7. It is more important that you……
8. It is well-known that……

### 7.50. Metaphors and Figurative Expressions

Every language has its metaphors or figurative expressions and English is no exception. Metaphors have one great value in a language in maintaining the balance of concrete imagery in it and preventing it from becoming a mere abstract, logical dialect of the scientists and professors. They preserve for it always the smell of the soil, as it were. The English language is considered a virile language just because it is full of metaphors and metaphorical uses of words. In spite of the great increase of scientific vocabulary, real modern English remains racy and fresh because of the many figurative uses of its simple and homely words.

Metaphors, therefore, greatly increase the expressiveness of one’s language. Sometimes, metaphors are used for elegant variation, as in calling a miser not a miser, but a Jew, or again, through further variation, a gentleman from Palestine. But usually, metaphors are used on their own merits—the merits of expressiveness. To call a wicked woman a she-devil is direct and to the point, and to call a man somebody’s under-dog is more forceful than to say he is somebody’s subservient servant. If a man is talking nonsense, it is easier to shut him up by calling it perfect rot than describing it as nonsensical talk. When a rich bourgeois merchant died with lots of money, it may be more appropriate to say that he cut up fat. The concrete imagery of a fat pig being cut up for the enjoyment of his relatives suggests many things which abstract terminology cannot. To tell the soldiers that they are cannon-fodder may have more persuasive force than volumes of prize essays on international peace. (Cf. the imagery in Chinese 組上魚肉, 釜底游魂, 甕中鱉.) Further examples are:—

A misplaced eyebrow: contemptuously of a small moustache.
A salamander: one who loves to sit by the fire.
A chatterbox: a woman given to chattering.
A dumb bell: (Amer. slang) one who does not understand, a fool.
Take a moral holiday: have a spree or indulge in temporary immorality.
Take rosy-coloured views: be optimistic.
The seamy side of life: the unseen and less beautiful side.
Make sheep’s eyes at lady: cast amorous glances.
An eyesore: person or thing one hates to see, e.g., dirty hut near a mansion, a poor relative, etc.
An eyewash: (slang) humbug, something made to deceive.
A bed of roses: easy and luxurious life.
A crumpled rose-leaf: small irritation in a happy life.
Eat one’s cake and still have it: it is impossible to enjoy two things at the same time.
Kill the goose that lays the golden eggs: for immediate benefit at the cost of the future.
Have one’s tail between one’s legs: show great fear or submission.
Hold the purse-strings: control money.

Such expressions could be multiplied without end.

It will be interesting to see how the simplest words in English, usually concrete in meaning, develop the greatest variety of metaphors. Following are some examples taken from the Concise Oxford Dictionary:—

Cat.—
That old cat＝悍婦，潑婦，老狐狸精。
A cat may look at a king＝一視何傷？
Living a cat-and-dog life＝夫妻反目，日夜吵架，雞犬不寧。
Let the cat out of the bag＝漏泄秘密，走漏風聲。
See which way the cat jumps＝取觀望態度，看風頭。
Cult of the jumping cat＝騎牆主義。
Rains cats and dogs＝大雨傾盆。
Not room to swing a cat＝無立錐之地。

Dog.—
Go to the dogs＝雞零狗碎，零落，破滅不可收拾。
Throw to the dogs＝唾棄；犧牲。
Every dog has his day＝瓦片也有翻身時。
Haven’t a dog’s chance＝極少希望。
Lead a dog’s life＝過窮苦生活，苟延殘喘。
Give a dog a bad name and hang him＝欲加之罪，何患無辭？
You lucky dog!＝好造化！好狗命！
Love me, love my dog＝打狗看主面，愛屋及烏。
Let sleeping dogs lie＝一動不如一靜，勿無事生非。
Dog in the manger＝狗佔馬槽（於自己無用者，且不肯讓人）。

Dust.—
Throw dust in one’s eyes＝欲圖蒙蔽。
Shake off the dust of one’s feet＝拂袖而去（不懼）。
Bite the dust = 戰敗倒斃.
In the dust = 歸土, 入黃泉.
Humbled to the dust = 大受挫辱, 辱在泥塗.
Raise a dust = 揚塵; 引申為 ‘引起糾紛.’
Dust and heat = 風塵勞頓, 汗馬之勞.

Finger.—
Done by the finger of God = 由于天意, 由于神力.
Lay one’s finger on = 指出 (病原等); 隨意拾得.
Look through one’s fingers at = 佯為不見.
Won’t stir a finger = 不拔一毛.
Turn or twist person round one’s finger or little finger = 作掌上傀儡, 任意播弄, 玩之股掌之上.
My fingers itch to = 手癢, 技渴, 渴想.
His fingers are all thumbs = 用手笨拙.
With a wet finger = 容易, 不費吹灰之力, 易如反掌.
Burn one’s finger = 自作孽; 好管閒事, 招惹是非.
Have a finger in the pie = 與聞, 染指.
Let slip through one’s fingers = 不覺放棄, 輕輕放過.
Have subject at one’s finger-tips = 娴熟, 拿手好戲.
To the finger-nails = 渾身, 自頂至踵, 一身 (都是膽).

To write a good, idiomatic English style, one should pay attention to such uses of the simple words. Chinese students of English are usually at home in the use of long words of Latin origin; a college dean, for instance, says of his new curriculum that “it epitomizes the processes of modernization of China.” He might have said that “it shows the modern changing China in a miniature,” or “it sums up in a nutshell, as it were, the various phases of changing China.” Few Chinese students are truly at home in the idiomatic use of simple English words. The secret of a good English style lies in mixing up the homely words with more high-brow ones, as Edward Sapir* has done when he speaks of “grammatical pattern” (for type of structure) and “the drift of language” (for tendency of language). Instead of saying, “Mr. MacDonald began to deal with the problem directly,” it would be an actual improvement in expressiveness to say that “he came to close grips with the problem.” Instead of saying, “Mr. Lloyd George’s efforts at pleasing some Conservatives,” one might speak of “Mr. Lloyd George’s flirtations with them” (cf. Chinese 吊膀子). And instead of saying, “He tries to locate the economic distress,” one could say, “He tries to find out where the shoe pinches,” and it would be better English.

*Author of “Language” (Harcourt, Brace, N. Y.)

### 7.60. Direct and Indirect Statements

Very often we want to quote or restate what another says. We have a direct quotation, with a capital and quotation marks in the following:—

Mr. Barker said to his son, “I am going away from the city for a few days, and you should come home to see your mother everyday.”

This can be made into an indirect statement as follows:—

Mr. Barker said to his son that he was going away from the city for a few days and that he, the son, should come home everyday to see his mother.

This is also a case of representation and the indirect statement may also be called a “represented statement.”

In direct quotations, we must use the exact words and consider the quotation marks as sacred. If words are omitted, we should indicate the omission by a dotted line.

In indirect statements, we do not bind ourselves to use the exact words, and naturally change the person of pronn. and the tense of vbb. according to the actual meaning.

Indirect questions have already been discussed in § 3.64. In indirect questions, we do not use the “inverted order” of vb and subject:—

Peterson asked: “Are you coming?” (Direct)
Peterson asked if he was coming. (Indirect)

While indirect statements are introduced by that, indirect questions are introduced by if, whether, how, when, what, etc. so that we get the following phrases:—

ask if                 ask why
ask whether           ask when
ask how               ask where
ask what              ask for what reason
ask who               ask by what means, etc.

Look up § 3.64 again for review.

In indirect commands and requests, the vbb. are usually expressed with the helping words should, would, are to, were to, etc. When the vb. alone is used, the infinitive form is used both for the past and present tenses. For example:—

It is our wish that he leave the city now.
It was our wish that he leave the city at once.

We may say:

It was our wish that he should leave the city at once,

which means the same thing as leaves. But to say:

It was our wish that he left at once

would imply that he actually left (indicative of fact) in accordance with our wish (cf. § 3.74).

Exercise 54. Change the following direct statements, questions and requests or commands into good and clear indirect statements, etc., and notice the changes in pron. and vbb. that you will have to make. Had to may be used for the past tense of must.

1. Peterson explained to his mother: “I must go now, for I have to meet a friend.”
2. His mother asked: “Why do you have to go in such a hurry? Is your friend more important than your mother? Can you not wait a while, till your sister returns?”
3. Peterson said: “There is no time to wait. Besides, my sister may not come home today at all.”
4. His mother replied: “If that is the case, go now. You must always have your own way. But come back early.”

### 7.61. Tense of Dependent Clauses

In the sentence—

Mr. Barker said that he was going away for a few days,

Mr. Barker said is called the “main clause,” and the clause introduced by that is called the “dependent clause,” because it depends on the main clause in meaning. As a rule, if the main clause is in past tense, the dependent clause should be in past tense also. Thus—

Mr. Barker said that he could come.

Here the speaker is simply repeating the words of Mr. Barker, and assumes no responsibility as to whether he will actually come or not. There are times when we can say:

Mr. Barker said that he can come.

This would more or less imply that the present speaker believes in him, and is willing to state it as a present fact that he can come. So also—

Mr. Barker said that the earth was round.
Mr. Barker said that the earth is round.

In the first sentence, the present speaker is simply repeating Mr. Barker’s words; whether the earth is round or not is none of the present speaker’s business. (Mr. Barker might have said it to his washerwoman, and we can imagine the washerwoman now quoting it with great respect for Mr. Barker’s opinions.) In the second sentence, the speaker is more or less willing to state it as a fact.

Exercise 55. Study the use of verbal tense in the following dependent clauses and find out the reason for its use:—

1. He just told me that he can come tonight.
2. He told me that you are bankrupt.
3. He said that he had been in Singapore for three years before he came here.
4. You go and tell him that I am a Singapore merchant myself and had never heard of his name when I was there.
5. Mr. Russell said in his lecture that prohibition has succeeded in making drinking very popular in America today.
6. Mr. Wu declared that he, too, was a revolutionist.
7. They asked him if he was a communist, and he said “No.”
8. Mr. Wu denied that we have failed in the revolution; he said that our present government was better than the Manchu Government.
9. It was reported in the North-China Daily News that three millions have died of famine in Shensi and that two-thirds of Kiangsi province are now under communist rule.
10. It was requested that the murderer be handed over to the Chinese authorities.
11. He was allowed to stay at home with the condition that he report at the police headquarters every morning.

### 7.70. Representation by Omission

Grammar should teach one how to omit, as well as how to express, things. As Jespersen has wisely remarked, “Only bores want to express everything, but even bores find it impossible to express everything.” Jespersen mentions as example the case of a man purchasing a railway ticket at the station and saying “Two third Brighton return,” which really represents, “Would you please sell me two third-class tickets from London to Brighton and back again, and I will pay you the usual fare for such tickets.” Economy of speech is usually the motive for representation, whether by use of pronn. or by other means. To say “five feet four” (four inches) and “three seventy-five” (three dollars seventy-five cents) implies as much a form of representation as to say “The book is mine or his” (my book, his book), or “buy it at the grocer’s” (grocer’s shop), or “She went to her uncle’s” (uncle’s home). Following are some idiomatic omissions:—

Got up at six (o’clock) thirty.
In the year nineteen (hundred) thirty-seven.
He stands five feet six (inches).
It measures four (feet wide) by five (feet long).
The price is seven (dollars and) fifty-five (cents).
But what (am I) to do (or: say)?
I have heard (people) say that . . . .
Live and let (others) live.
Help (to) make it a success.
I help him (to get) over the stile, down the bridge, up the wall, out of a difficulty.
Her stepmother made her (to) sweep, scrub and clean.
I feel (I) like going out today.
He dare not (to) appear.

(1) The avoiding of repetition is one of the common causes for omission or suppression of words. Thus—

The upper (shelf) and the lower shelf.
His old (associates) and new associates.
Good-bye to the old year and welcome to the new (year)!
Cut off the first and last parts of the play, and leave the middle (part of the play).
I told you to come at nine o’clock, and you come at eleven (o’clock).
He can (do it) and will do it.
I can do it, but dare not (do so).
He could not do it, and would not (do it) if he could (do it):
He has inherited and (has) spent his fortune.
A new government had been established and (had been) overthrown in the course of the three days.
He was jeered, (was) hooted, (was) made fun of, and (was) dragged off from the stage.
I know you and (I know) him.
He brought his wife and (he brought his) children.
He lost his wife, (his) three children and (his) property.
His wife is taller than he (is tall).
You love her more than (you love) me.

In strictly correct English, one should not let one helping vb. represent by omission another which is not exactly the same. We can say “He had fought and (had) been defeated,” but we should not say “He was defeated and they (were) victorious.” Because were is different from was, it should be expressed and not omitted.

Exercise 56. (I) Repetition is not grammatically wrong, and is sometimes very expressive, but see if you can avoid the repetition of words, when you want to.

1. He gave him five dollars and gave me only three dollars.
2. This is seven o’clock, and you said it was eight o’clock.
3. We have searched the house and have found nothing.
4. He has come and has gone already.
5. The man was immediately taken to the hospital and was treated by a doctor.
6. You have learnt nothing and have forgotten nothing.
7. In three months’ time, he has bought a house, has insured it for $35,000, has burnt it down, and has got the money for it.
8. He has successively married seven women, has divorced six of them and has made a present of the seventh one to General Chang.

(II) Correct the following by changing the tense of vbb. or filling in words where omissions are unjustified:—
1. I came here to see the city and met a few friends.
2. I intended to go to Tsingtau and spent the summer there.
3. After the storm was over, we found that our house alone was intact, while all the others destroyed.
4. Many men have built the house and one man torn it down.

(2) For psychological reasons, we often omit the beginning or the last part of a sentence, when we consider the part expressed as sufficiently clear. This is true especially in answers to questions. In this sense, “Yes” and “No” may stand for almost anything expressed in the question. Also—

How many do you want? (Ans.) Four.
Would you have it (the egg) fried or scrambled? (Ans.) Fried.
Would you have it boiled hard or soft? (Ans.) Soft, or medium.
Is this quarter past three? (Ans.) No, ten past.
Would you have tea or coffee? (Ans.) Coffee.
Shall I bring you a pen or a pencil? (Ans.) Both.
Do you like it? (Ans.) Rather!

In very common expressions, we often omit the first one or two syllables, out of simple laziness.

(Good) Morning!                          (I am) Present!
(Will) That do?                         (He or She is) Absent!
(You) See what I mean?                  (I am) Sorry.
(I am) Here!                            Fraid not. (=I am afraid not)
(I) Thank you!
(I) Beg your pardon.
(I hope to) See you tomorrow.
(Do you) Remember that letter?
(Think of) What people will say!
(That’s) Impossible!
(That’s) A good idea!
(Do it) Gently, please.
(It’s) Well done.
(Let’s) Have done!
(Keep your) Hands up (or: off)!
(Be) Quick!

On the other hand, we may have what Jespersen calls “pull-up sentences,” where the last part is left omitted as being unnecessary for the understanding of the complete meaning. The to with the vb. omitted is quite common in such endings.

He never came, although I told him to (come).
He did not take off the cover, although I had told him to (do so).
Come with me, if you care to (come).
Would you come?—I should love to (come).
We have asked him to pay at the end of this month, and he says he is willing to (do so).

Other kinds of quite common pull-up sentences are:—

I told him he was wrong, and he admitted quite as much (as what I said).
But Shaw is quite as great an author (as any we have been discussing).
He is not nearly so great (as the other one).
Chen-teh comes from the same place (where I come from).
I don’t like to offend one so powerful (as he).

Truer types of pull-up sentences are, for example:—

Well, I never (heard of such a thing)!
Well, go to (the thing you want to do, and I will not object)!
If I only knew about this an hour ago!

It would be bad grammar not to recognize these as complete sentences simply because some of their parts are understood. Such grammar could be a hindrance, instead of a help, to the power of expression.
