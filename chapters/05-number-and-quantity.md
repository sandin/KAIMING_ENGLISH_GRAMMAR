## CHAPTER V NUMBER AND QUANTITY

### 5.10. The Notions of Number and Quantity

There are things that can be numbered or counted (boy, book, ship, school), and things that cannot be numbered or counted (water, air, fame, honesty). This applies to all languages. It would be nonsense to say "one water," "two water" either in Chinese or in English. For things that cannot be counted, however, we can express their quantity or amount, as "much water," "a little water," "a great deal of water," and "a basin (or basinful) of water." The difference expressed by one boy, two boys is called number (數), while the difference expressed by much water, little water is called quantity (量).

This distinction between number and quantity, however, is not kept in the Chinese notion of to (多) and shao (少). Thus, we say in Chinese 僧多粥少, disregarding the fact that monks can be counted, but congee cannot. In English, we have to say "many monks" (not "much monks"), but "little congee" (not "few congee").

**NUMBER**
- many dollars, cents
- many weeks, days
- many books, stories
- many heads
- three more chances
- too few lessons
- a few sick men
- two or three dishes

**QUANTITY**
- much money
- much time
- much reading
- much thinking
- little chance (possibility)
- too little grammar
- a little pain, sickness
- not much food

**NUMBER**
- many good qualities
- a number of cups
- a large number of letters
- three volumes, copies

**QUANTITY**
- a great deal of pride
- a big quantity of tea
- a big quantity of mail
- a little history, poetry

But even the English language does not observe this distinction in some words. The words some, a lot, more, no can be applied to both classes of words. Thus we have:

| For countable things | For uncountable things |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| some days, weeks | some time |
| some rooms | some space |
| some books, lessons | some knowledge, grammar |
| some chances | some possibility, chance |
| some good dishes | some food |
| a lot of showers | a lot of rain |
| lots of tables | lots of wood |
| more ships | more speed |
| less shipwrecks | less danger |
| no lamp | no light |

**Exercise 39.** Make some sentences with the following material:

- **Words:** many, too many, not many, not much, a great deal of, no little, a great number of, a good deal of, a little less, some more
- **Nouns:** ink, rain, sunshine, chances, beautiful girls, noise, pride, bowls, food, money, kindness, good luck, harm, danger, light

### 5.11. Mass-Words: Grain of Sand, Bushel of Rice, etc.

Besides the things that can be counted and are usually counted, there is a group of things that can be counted, but usually are not counted. Thus we say You eat a great deal of rice / She has beautiful hair / There's a large quantity of sand. We never trouble to count the rice we eat, or the hair on a woman's head, or the sand a child is playing with. When we want to count it, or express the number, we can say a grain of rice, a piece of hair, three grains of sand. These may be called countable mass-words.

Then, we have the mass-words that really cannot be counted, but can only be measured by measures of quantity. Sometimes, we can count the drops of rain and drops of water, but nobody can count the drops of water in a basin or a river. We can, however, measure water, as we can also measure the countable mass-words such as sand, fruit and rice. Thus we can say a bushel of rice or sand, and a pint of water. The following expressions of quantity are useful:

- **One pint** (about two tumblerfuls) = 品脫 (流質量名,約二玻璃杯額)
- **One gallon** (8 pints) = 咖喻 (八品脫)
- **A picul** = 擔,石
- **A bushel** = 斗
- **Three inches of snowfall or rain fall** = 雪積三(英)寸,雨量三(英)寸之高
- **One ampère** (electric current or flow) = 安培
- **One volt** (electro-motive force or strength: a 100-volt current cannot make a 220-volt lamp bright enough, because the force or strength is not sufficient) = 伏特
- **One watt** (electro-motive power as measured by work done: a 220-volt bulb means a bulb suitable for an electric force of 220 volts, but a 70-watt bulb means a bulb that can give so much light, about 100 candle-powers. Thus bulbs in the same city generally must have the same voltage, but may have different degrees of lighting power) = 瓦,瓦特
- **Thirty-two candle power(s)** (speaking of lights) = 三十二支光 (燭力)
- **Fifteen horse-power(s)** = 十五馬力 (h.p.) (one h.p. = the power to lift 550 pounds a foot high during a second)

**Expressions of quantity:**
- Tons of money — 大堆,整千整萬
- Heaps of work — 大堆
- Piles of letters — 大堆
- Lots of rice 許多
- A lot of time 許多
- A quantity of paper 多少
- A big amount of money 大家 (數額)
- An ocean of printing type — 片茫茫
- A mountain of printing paper 堆牀疊架
- A sea of faces 人山人海
- A shower of criticism 一陣
- A package of things 一包
- A packet of presents 一捆
- A sack of flour 一袋
- A wilderness of sweets (遍野) 極多
- A world of trouble 極多,無窮
- A mouthful of water 一口
- A handful of men (一把) 幾個
- A spoonful of salt 一湯匙
- A jugful of water 一水瓶
- A basketful of flowers 一籃,一筐
- A tumblerful of milk 一玻璃杯
- A tin of tomato soup 一罐
- A bag of clothing 一袋
- A pack of letters 一束
- A jar of honey 一瓶
- A pot of tea 一壺
- A bunch of grapes 一束

Many of these words can of course be used for countable things also, as a bag of letters, beans or fruits. We can say a lot of, a pile of, an ocean of, or lots of, piles of, oceans of with practically no difference in meaning. For collective words, see § 5.23. See also § 6.20 for expressions of weight, and § 6.40 for expressions of size and distance.

**Exercise 40.** Try to use the expressions "a number of" and "a quantity of" in several sentences and show the contrast in meaning.

### 5.12. Abstract Nouns: Piece of Luck

We have seen already (§ 4.22) that abstract nn. can be made concrete by the addition of words like case, instance, form, piece, bit, act, etc. Thus we cannot count abstract "information," but we can count the "pieces of information." Also, we cannot count "foolishness" or "malaria," but we can count the "acts of foolishness (or folly)" and "cases of malaria." Otherwise, abstract nn. are used like mass-words, as a great deal of kindness, much kindness, no little care, no little trouble, etc.

**Exercise 41.** Try to use the words instances, cases, forms, acts, piece, bit in connexion with abstract words like punishment, pleasure, theft, typhoid fever, nonsense, trouble, divorce, marriage, jealousy, poverty, disloyalty, dishonesty.

### 5.20. The Plural Endings -s and -es

In English, we distinguish between singular (one thing) and plural (more than one). As remarked above, mass-words and abstract nn. have no number but only quantity, and so are not included here in the study of number. Most English nn. now have come to use the ending -s as a sign of the plural number. We may call these plurals in -s (or -es) regular plurals, while other plurals not so formed may be called irregular plurals.

This -s ending is normally or usually pronounced as [z]. Only after p, t, k do we have the pronunciation [-ps, -ts, -ks], because p, t, k have no voice but only breath, and it is unnatural to put in voice again with a [z]. After the sounds [s, z, ʃ, ʒ, tʃ, dʒ], we say [iz] and spell the ending with -es, because it is difficult to pronounce s-z, ch-z, j-z, etc. together. Practise pronouncing the following words correctly:

**[-z]**
- songs
- fees
- eyes
- rickshas
- twos
- heroes
- potatoes
- laws
- rows
- days
- boys
- tins
- hens

**[-dz]**
- hands
- birds
- beds
- kinds
- cards

**[-ps]**
- cups
- caps
- tips
- heaps
- ropes

**[-ts]**
- seats
- hats
- rats
- cats
- carts
- streets
- hearts
- students
- moments

**[-siz]**
- cases
- faces
- laces
- classes
- boxes
- courses
- voices
- bases
- pieces

**[-ʃiz]**
- ashes
- dishes
- bushes
- fishes
- wishes

**[-tʃiz]**
- churches
- matches
- torches
- watches

**[-ks]**
- weeks
- books
- mistakes
- marks
- cakes
- brooks
- dikes

**[-ziz]**
- noses
- roses
- phrases
- causes
- noises
- exercises
- diseases

**[-dʒiz]**
- ages
- edges
- pages
- judges
- bridges

With nn. ending in [s, θ, f] sounds, these sounds are often (but not always) changed into [z, ð, v], due to the influence of the voiced [z]. This change in pronunciation is sometimes indicated in the spelling, and sometimes not. [ð] is pronounced like th in this, thee, quite akin to [z].

**[-s — -ziz]**
- house—houses

**[-θ — -ðz]**
- bath—baths
- path—paths
- youth—youths
- oath—oaths
- month—months
- wreath—wreaths
- cloth [-ɔ(:)-]—clothes [-ou-]

**[-f — -vz]**
- wife—wives
- life—lives
- knife—knives
- self—selves
- shelf—shelves
- calf—calves
- leaf—leaves
- thief—thieves
- loaf—loaves
- staff [-ɑː]-staves [-ei-]

The plurals clothes, staves (piece of clothing, wooden strip in a tub) have developed meanings different from the singular. The change in pronunciation does not occur in all words of the same endings. Thus we have:
- [-siz] in horses, cases, races, courses.
- [-əs] in hearths [hɑːrθs], heaths, months, tenths.
- [-fs] in roofs, proofs, chiefs, safes, strifes.

In truths and earths, usage still varies: both [ðz] and [θs] are used.

### 5.21. Boys, Ladies, Pianos, Potatoes

Nn. ending in y and o are sometimes written with -ys, -os, and sometimes -ies, -oes in their plural forms. There is a fairly good rule for nn. in -y, but there is nothing but utter confusion in the case of the nn. in -o, and the best advice is to look up the dictionary whenever in doubt.

**"-ys" [y after vowel]**
- boys, toys, days, trays (also, pulleys, whys)

**"-ies" [y after consonant]**
- ladies, stories, kiddies, flies, duties, armies

**"-os" [o after vowel]**
- bamboos, Hindoos, taboos, folios, curios, embryos, portfolios
- [long words]: generalissimos, archipelagos, manifestos, negritos
- [foreign-looking words]: pianos, solos, photos, grottos, fiascoes, albinos
- [proper names]: Romeos, Galileos, Neros

**"-oes" [some familiar plurals]**
- potatoes, heroes, negroes, mosquitoes, buffaloes

English spelling is here unreasonable, as usual, but there is nothing else to do except following the usage.

### 5.22. Irregular Plurals: Fish, Dozen and Alumni

The plurals dealt with in the preceding sections may be considered regular plurals. There are some English plurals which do not add an -s, or which add nothing at all.

**(a) Irregular Changes**
- tooth—teeth
- foot—feet
- goose—geese
- mouse—mice
- ox—oxen
- brother—brethren (brothers)
- child—children

**(b) No Change**
- 3,000 cattle
- 450 sheep
- A lot of fish, salmon, trout
- Keep fowl, sheep, swine
- Shoot 20 snipe, wild duck, deer
- Three dozen [adj.] apples
- Three dozen [n.] of apples—but: dozens of them, did it dozens of times, pack it in dozens
- Three score and ten (=seventy)
- Three hundred [adj.] bottles
- Take three hundred [n.]—but: have seen hundreds of them, hundreds and thousands

Most of these keep the singular form because they are regarded as collectives (cattle as a whole, fish as a whole, three dozen as a whole), or as mass-words (snipe, duck, deer—hunted because of their flesh, which is a mass-word). When these words are not so regarded, we can use the plural forms with -s (some fishes, ducks or fowls in the backyard). In our human selfishness, we often think of the flesh in the hunted animals, and forget that they are individual beings. This is especially clear in the phrase "fish, flesh and fowl" (魚, 肉, 雞鴨等). Cattle, swine and sheep are never used with -s as collective nn. Dozen, score, hundred, thousand generally do not take an -s when used after words of number (five dozen, a few hundred, but dozens and hundreds).

**(c) Foreign Plurals**

**Latin**
- alumnus—alumni
- datum—data
- medium—media
- stratum—strata
- bacterium—bacteria
- genius—genii
- larva—larvae
- formula—formulæ (or: formulas)
- index—indices (or: indexes)
- appendix—appendices (or: appendixes)
- series—series
- species—species
- apparatus—apparatus (or: apparatuses)

**Hebrew**
- cherub—cherubim (or: cherubs)
- seraph—seraphim (or: seraphs)

**Greek**
- analysis—analyses
- thesis—theses
- crisis—crises
- hypothesis—hypotheses
- phenomenon—phenomena
- criterion—criteria (or: criterions)

**French**
- bureau—bureaux
- monsieur—messieurs
- madam(e)—mesdames

**Russian**
- Bolshevik—Bolsheviki (or: Bolsheviks)
- Menshevik—Mensheviki (or: Mensheviks)

### 5.23. Collectives: Government Have and Government Has

We have seen already (§ 4.50) that collective nn. can be considered as singular (one group) or as plural (many individuals). Of course, collective nn. may have plurals also, as "the different nations," "all the classes," "the European Governments." The peculiar thing is that the singular collective may be used both as singular and as plural Thus, we say There are, or is, a group of boys, all depending on whether we are thinking of the group or of the boys. It is better to say The class elect him as representative than The class elects him as representative, because it is the class members who do the electing. On the other hand, it is better to say The class is represented by him rather than The class are represented by him, because we mean the class as a whole is represented. Study also the following:

- The train (dead thing) arrives (never arrive).
- The library (dead thing) was burnt (not were).
- There are (or is) a class of words called "collectives."
- The family have (or has) moved out.
- The Jewish tribe are (or is) a wandering race.
- The people are standing in the rain.
- The Chinese nation is becoming westernized.
- Look at the crowd. They must number over 10,000.
- If you let the other class know, they will laugh at you.
- One thousand people. Twelve clergy. Twenty police. Six hundred sheep.

What one must remember is to be consistent. We should not say, "The Cabinet has decided at their last meeting," or "The Cabinet have decided at its last meeting," although this is a natural and common mistake, due to change of mind or carelessness. It always makes for clearness to use the words the members of, when we mean the separate individuals in the group.

**Exercise 42.** Try to use the following collective words and expressions:

1. The members of the class.
2. The members of the church.
3. The members of the family.
4. A group of people, students, children.
5. A flock of sheep, geese.
6. A herd of cattle.
7. A pack of thieves, fools, rascals, monkeys, hounds.
8. A bunch of ne'er-do-wells, fools, green-horns.
9. A gang of thieves, ruffians, politicians.
10. A party of travellers, guests, visitors.
11. A set of instruments, papers, books.
12. A suit of clothing, a suite of rooms.
13. A swarm of bees, insects, ants, beggars.
14. An army of beggars, workers, troops.
15. A troop of monkeys, soldiers, fighters.
16. A crowd of spectators, men and women.
17. A troupe or company of actors, acrobats, magicians.
18. A caravan of camels, merchants across the desert.
19. A batch of returned students, graduates (of the same year).

### 5.24. Psychological Intent: Three Weeks Is Heaps of Time

When we say "Five dollars is too dear," or "Ten minutes is enough," or "Three years is too long for an engagement," we are really using a "collective" meaning, so the vb. in the singular is quite right, and English commonsense has triumphed over grammatical nonsense. Similarly, we can say:

- Three weeks is heaps of time.
- Another three days was wasted.
- Every five minutes he dropped in once.
- Take any three of them.
- Before three days was passed, the landlord came again.
- Take that three dollars and buy yourself a new straw hat.
- Their honeymoon lasted only seventeen days. But that wonderful two weeks and half (or: two-weeks-and-half) was the happiest time of her life.

In the expression "mother and child" (母女倆兒) the conception is really "collective" although we seldom use a singular vb. with it. Similarly, we have the following:

- They are a second Romeo and Juliet (pair of sweethearts).
- He is a second (Dr.) Jekyll and (Mr.) Hyde (double personality).
- The husband and wife look like brother and sister.
- This ball and socket is broken.
- He was riding in a coach-and-four (horses).
- Hand me that cup and saucer.
- Bread and butter is a kind of food.
- The whole bag and baggage was thrown out into the street.
- Peace and security is what we want.
- Sympathy and understanding is (or: are) required.
- Six and six is (or: are) twelve.

### 5.25. The Generic Singular

When we say "Man is mortal," we are using man as a class-word, meaning "All men are mortal." We make the singular man represent all members of mankind. Generally we use the article the in this connexion, but a may also be used with the same meaning. When we mean to say that "大學畢業生沒有事做, 沒有飯吃, 比比皆然," we can either say "The university graduate has nowhere to earn his living," or "University graduates have, etc." Study the following:

- There is nothing to be proud of for the teacher to cram ever so many grammatical rules and definitions into the student's head.
- The Chinese student of English is often misled by the English spelling.
- The student often remembers his marks and forgets about his studies.
- Everything has been done for the comfort of the traveller.
- The policeman is supposed to be courteous to the public.
- The King Ching of Ch'i [齊景公] says, "If the king is not like a king, the minister is not like a minister, the father is not like a father, and the son is not like a son, how am I going to get anything to eat, even if the people have rice?" [信如君不君, 臣不臣, 父不父, 子不子, 雖有粟, 吾得而食諸?]
- Mencius says, "If the ruler regards the minister (or: ministers) as dust and grass, then the minister (or: ministers) will regard the ruler as his (or: their) enemy." [君之視臣如土芥, 則臣視君如寇讎.]
- The Chinese woman is never oppressed by the man (or: the men), but by her own sex.
- The life of the Chinese daughter-in-law is a pretty hard one.
- The fox is a night prowling animal.

**Exercise 43.** Learn to use some of the following expressions referring to whole classes:

1. a (or: the) son's duty
2. the smoker's throat (irritation due to smoking)
3. an (or: the) actor's life
4. a (or: the) child's teeth
5. the scientist's method
6. the Englishman in China
7. the student's studies
8. the use of the diploma
9. the ass's ['æsiz] ears
10. the cat's-paws
11. the foreigner in China
12. the modern girl
13. the rickshaw coolie

### 5.26. Natural Plurals

There are objects which naturally go in pairs (as trousers, scales, scissors), or in greater number (as measles, ashes, suds), and it is natural that we use these habitually in the plural form with -s. When such pairs or sets of things can be easily separated, then of course the singular is also occasionally used, as a shoe (but not a trouser), and a wave, a bubble (but not a sud). All this is very natural. In referring to them as one thing, we generally say a pair of scissors, a pair of breeches, etc. Further examples are:

- pincers 鉗子
- forceps 外科鉗子
- tongs 火鉗
- bellows 風箱
- compasses 圓規
- spectacles 眼鏡
- cross-roads 十字街
- arrangements 設備,接洽
- preparations 部署,籌備
- embers 灰燼
- remains 遺骸
- arms 兵器
- colours 大旗
- bowels 腸肚
- intestines 腸
- lungs 肺臟
- proceeds 贏利
- earnings 收入
- belongings 所有物件
- surroundings 周圍
- grounds 宅地
- contents 內容
- assets 房產
- odds and ends 零碎什物

We seldom say the preparation or arrangement for a departure, but the preparations or arrangements, because naturally there are many things to prepare. (On the other hand, we may say the arrangement of the room and the preparation for tomorrow's lesson, because the meaning is clearly singular.) A person's earnings, belongings, and a company's assets are also generally plural in number, so the use of plural is quite natural.

Notice also the natural use of plurals in the following:

- shake hands with = 握手
- change places with = 易地而居
- be (or make) friends with = 交友
- be quits with = 兩相抵消, 兩無負欠
- rub shoulders with = 耳鬢廝磨

Usage varies with regard to the names of the sciences ending in -ics, as physics, mathematics, ethics, classics, metaphysics, esthetics. These nn. may be used both as singulars and as plurals (Mathematics is or are). But, generally, it is better to use them as singulars when referring to the sciences, and as plurals when referring to a more general meaning. E.g.:

- Physics is changing our conceptions of the universe.
- Mathematics is easy to teach when you can make it interesting to the students.
- His mathematics (figures and counting) are all wrong.
- The acoustics (resonance of sound) of the hall are very bad.
- The ethics of the play are above criticism.

Even here no hard and fast rule can be laid down, and a great deal of freedom is allowed—and taken.

### 5.27. Differentiated Plurals

It is also natural that the plurals of a good many words develop definite meanings which are different from the singulars. Arms means the different weapons, such as rifles, swords and bayonets, and goods means things sold or bought by merchants Study the following:

| Singular | Plural | Singular | Plural |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| custom 風俗 | *customs 關稅 | pain 痛 | pains 勞力 |
| manner 式樣 | manners 禮貌 | quarter 四分之一 | quarters 住所 |
| moral 箴言 | morals 道德 | news 新聞 | news 新聞 |
| letter 字母 | letters 文學 | means 方法,工具 | means 方法,工具 |
| *paper 紙張 | papers 公文,報章 | wage 工資 | wages 工資 |
| *advice 勸告 | advices 通知 | tiding 消息 | tidings 消息 |
| *air 空氣 | airs 神氣 | glass 玻璃 | glasses 眼鏡 |
| look 視 | looks 形貌 | gut 腸 | guts 魄力,耐力 |
| brain 腦 | brains 腦力 | work 工作 | works 工廠,作品 |

It should be noticed that (a) words marked * have also the meaning of the corresponding singular or plural, as an air of contempt, a state paper, the customs of the country; (b) means and news are used both as singulars and plurals; and (c) the singular forms wage and tiding are very seldom used. Examples of the use of these plurals are:

- Take great pains (=take trouble) to ...
- Have received advices not to ship the goods.
- The Prince's living quarters.
- He has no guts in him.
- The paper works. The works of an author.
- Must find a means to reach him.
- Received this news yesterday.
- He has no manners.
- She is proud of her looks.
- The news was published in the papers.

### 5.23. Some Special Cases: Sons-in-Law, the Miss Rogers, etc.

These are (a) compound words where the -s must be added to the principal words, (b) compound words with no clear principal words, (c) proper names, (d) letters and figures, (e) words or phrases quoted, and (f) phrases where the first n. is used as an adj. and, therefore cannot take an -s.

### 5.30. Numerals, Fractions and Multiples

The greatest difficulty in English counting for the Chinese student is the expression of the Chinese idea of wan (萬), which is "ten thousand" in English. When the student wishes to express his idea of wan in terms of thousands, he must remember to multiply it by ten. The next thing to remember is that a hundred wan makes a "million," and hence a thousand wan is simply "ten million." No end of confusion has been caused by this difference in notion.

- one wan = ten thousand 10,000
- ten wan = hundred thousand 100,000
- hundred wan = one million 1,000,000
- thousand wan = ten million 10,000,000
- ten wan wan = one billion 1,000,000,000

The English way of counting is really very clear through its division into threes in the reading of long sums; thus 1,001,000 is easily seen to be one million and one thousand, while 10,010,000 is ten million and ten thousand. Also there is more regard for accuracy in English statements of number; thus a meeting of "over one wan people" in Chinese is really the equivalent of a meeting of "fifteen hundred people" or so in English.

The expressions fifteen hundred or seventeen hundred fifty (for 1,500 or 1,750) are quite common for figures below two thousand. The year "1930" should therefore be read as nineteen (hundred) thirty, which is better than the clumsy one thousand nine hundred thirty.

For ordinals (first, second, etc.), see § 8.50.

Learn also the following expressions of fractions and multiples, and vary them for yourself:

**(1) Percentage and fractions**
1. One-third (1/3); two-thirds (2/3); three-quarters (3/4); four-fifths (4/5); nine-tenths (9/10); one-fiftieth of a second [一秒五十分之一]
2. One-third of it is gone. One third of them are gone.
3. Seven-tenths (of the men) are over twenty (years old).
4. This is two-thirds water. Two-thirds of it is (or are) water.
5. Eighty-five per cent (85%) are illiterate. We have eighty-five per cent illiteracy.

### 5.40. Conflict of Number

There are cases where it may be hard to decide whether a singular or a plural should be used. Such troubles never arise in the Chinese language because we do not distinguish the singular and plural endings. English usage, however, has established certain unwritten rules which must be noticed here.

(a) One or two days. One or two cases. (Cf. a week or two, a case or two)
(b) Many a man thinks, etc. More than one person (for the vb., see next paragraph "f")
(c) An upper and a lower shelf. The upper and the lower shelf. (But: the upper and lower shelves) Both the old and the new dress. (But: the old and new dresses) We welcome the new, and say good-bye to the old year.

When a or the is repeated, we use the singular, because in the upper and the lower shelf, we seem to have the word shelf understood already after the upper: the upper (shelf) and the lower shelf. Similarly, We welcome the new (year), etc.

(d) In the case of one thing which belongs to several persons, the case may be quite clear when we mean their house or their houses, their (common) journey, but their (separate) wives (unless they have a common wife). But it may not be so clear when we have a more abstract meaning. Shall we say their meaning or their meanings? and They have made up their mind or minds? Generally when we have a more abstract meaning, we use the singular (§ 4.30), otherwise, we use the plural. Thus we may say "Their heads (腦袋) look alike," but "They don't use their head" (abstract singular = 用頭腦, 用腦力). Also, in regular phrases, we usually keep the singular, as "They came on foot (by walking)," "They took a fancy to her." Thus:

- They have no use (abstract)
- The uses (separate) of the different parts
- The soldiers appeared in uniform (phrase)
- The men appeared in formal dress (phrase)
- The women wore bright-coloured dresses (some in green, some in lavender, etc.)
- The life (abstract) of the peasants
- The lives (separate) of great men
- Those three had also a hand (abstract, = a share) in the matter
- We must wash our faces (or even face, regarding "washing face" as a regular phrase). But: We must tell them this to save our face (abstract, = honour, good name [面子])
- All of them are in trouble (phrase). But: All of them are in troubles of some sort or other (separate)
- The foreigners can leave our internal wars alone; they need not put their foot in it (= they need not interfere; not feet, them)
- This happened right under the nose (not noses) of the authorities
- We must keep an eye on that young girl (= watch her and keep her from going wrong)
- Opium-smokers always have a bad digestion
- People who want to preserve our "old morality" generally have a bad conscience
- People who oppose the emancipation of women generally lead an immoral life (or immoral lives, = have concubines, seduce young girls, etc)
- Men of bad temper, strong determination, good health, poetic imagination (all abstract words)
- Words of different gender, number, meaning, case, etc.

We even often say those kind of things, those kind of people (besides that kind and those kinds).

### 5.41. Number in Verbs

The English language still distinguishes have and has, is and are, comes and come, although it does not distinguish the singular and plural of had, did, came (but was and were). This has given rise to many unnecessary difficulties, over which the best writers from Shakespeare, Milton, Swift to Shelley, Thackeray and Macaulay often stumble.* The case is quite clear when you have A boy goes, Two boys go, but in What China needs are good roads, the best minds often get confused and become helpless. Many of these difficulties are due to psychological causes (forgetfulness, unpreparedness, change of mind, influence of the nearest words, etc.). One should try to avoid these errors by keeping a sharp look-out.

(1) Subject and complement in different number: follow the subject

- My only pleasure is the movies
- The movies are my only pleasure
- All that is simply ways of deceiving the people
- The Greeks were a wonderful race
- Our only guide is the stars
- The stars are our only guide
- His food was fruit and goat-milk
- Fruit and goat-milk were his food

(2) One of those is, one of those who are: see what you mean

We say "One of the boys is sick," but "He is one of the boys who are sick." In the latter case, there are evidently many sick boys. It is easy to forget this, when the phrase is longer. In the following, the real logical subjects are indicated with bold face

- The meeting of so many strangers of so many nationalities broadens his mind
- The putting together of so many incongruous colours is displeasing to the eye
- The loss of his mother, wife and three of his beloved children is too much for him
- The apples grown on this hill have a special flavour of their own
- The results of the examination show that you have been making considerable progress
- One (1) of his concubines (2), who all have (2) their lovers, runs (1) away with hers
- This is one of the best games that are ever played in Shanghai
- One of the books he bought yesterday is torn. (He bought many, but one is torn)
- He is one of those who always forget their engagements

(3) Subjects of mixed number: use plural verbs

Here we can have several possibilities:
- (1) Mother and child were kidnapped
- (2) Mother and children were kidnapped
- (3) Mother or child was kidnapped
- (4) Mother or children were kidnapped

Only the last case calls for attention. Examples are:
- One or two examples have to be given
- There are one or two things that you must remember

(4) Verbs before subjects: think of your subject beforehand

The most common form is a sentence beginning with there is, as There is one thing, but There are a number of things. The difficulty is, we may begin by thinking of one thing, and then later on think of other things: There is a big pearl and (after-thought) a number of smaller ones (are should be used). Mistakes of this kind are practically impossible to avoid in speaking, because the after-thought actually comes after the phrase there is is spoken already, and they are to be found in the writings of the best authors. Consequently, there is some justification for it even in writing. A lady whose attention is captivated and whose soul is set on fire by the sight of a big pearl naturally says—

There is a big pearl of wonderful roundness and lustre and a number of smaller ones in her necklace.

and it is hard to condemn her for her bad grammar. A punctilious writer would even purposely write:—

There is a big pearl of wonderful roundness and lustre in her necklace, and a number of smaller ones, besides.

Here is is better than are because the expression is rounded off by in her necklace for the first part, and the second part can be regarded as elliptical with there are understood.* Except in such constructions, however, one should generally think of his subject before he uses the verb. Following are correct examples:

- In the room are a table, a bed, and a piano
- Now come all trials and experiences that can happen to a man
- Under this roof are gathered today the most distinguished names of the country
- Under "university students" are included both post-graduates and under-graduates
- In this city are to be found both the most renowned scholars and the worst scoundrels of the country
- Here are the papers he left for you to read
- There are a full-page coloured illustration and many smaller ordinary ones in this book

Where's your manners? is also quite idiomatic.

(5) Pronouns of common number: see which is meant

The pron. who, what, which, none, any, more may refer to singular or plural. They are therefore singular or plural according to the circumstances: Who is my friend? but Who are my friends? The same is true of the relative pron. who, which and that: the thing that angers me, the things that anger me, those who are too lazy, etc.

Further examples are:

- More of us die in bed than out of it
- The more is added, the less it becomes
- None of us are (or is) willing to die
- None but the brave deserves the fair (but a prep)
- None but the fools are prepared to believe, that
- There is (or are) none left
- Is any of your sisters out?
- Are any of your sisters out?

With what, one should be much more careful:

- This is, then, what seem to be the reasons for his resignation
- This is what seems to be the reason for his resignation
- The paper will publish what are considered the best essays on the subject

In the case of a noun clause beginning with what, one should always treat it as singular:

- What you say is quite true
- What China needs is good roads (cf. examples under "a")
- What angered him was the personal attacks (Cf. The personal attacks were what angered him)

(6) Each, as well as, many a, more than one

These are special cases. Each, many a and more than one with nn. in the singular almost always take the singular verb. The noun following as well as should be entirely excluded in the consideration of the number of the vb.

- Each has something to say
- Each of them strikes the ball in turn
- Each of the stories is copied by one student
- The students copy each a story
- They strike the ball each one after the other
- Many a man has been cheated by him
- More than one person was suspected. But there are more than one person involved in the matter (are due to the influence of the nearest more)
- He, as well as his room-mates, is suspected
- His room-mates, as well as he, are suspected

We should also use himself (and not themselves) for each, every one and anybody. (Sometimes himself or herself is used, but too frequent use of this is mere foolishness.) On the other hand, nobody may take sometimes a they after it.

- Nobody objects to it, do they? (From No one of them objects)
- Anybody can see this for himself
- Every one should sign his or her name in the book
- Every one must make his (quite enough without or her) own living
- Each man is fighting for himself

For collective nn. (class is, class are) see § 5.23, and for fractions, multiples and words of number (seven per cent is or are) see § 5.30.
