## CHAPTER VI WEIGHT, VALUE, SIZE, SHAPE AND POSITION

### 6.10. National Differences in These Categories.
The English expressions of weight, value, size, distance, position and shape differ quite considerably from the Chinese. One should learn to use these expressions correctly and to know their exact meaning.

### 6.20. Expressions of Weight.
There are in measures of weight, as in measures of size and distance, two systems, one the old English system which is in general use, and the other the so-called "metric" system, more in scientific use. The metric system is quite simple. Both gram and gramme may be used in all these words.

- gram = about 15 Troy grains
- decagram = 10 grams
- hectogram = 100 grams
- kilogram = 1,000 grams
- decigram = 10th of 1 gram
- centigram = 100th of 1 gram
- milligram = 1,000th of 1 gram

The most common term is kilogram which is about 2.2 ordinary pounds. In the old English system, there are again two series of weight measures: one the common weight, or avoirdupois (pr. [,ævədʊ'pɔɪz]) weight, and the other used by gold- and silversmiths, called Troy weight. The avoirdupois pound is heavier than the Troy pound, and is equal to 12 Chinese ounces. Study the following equivalents (the abbreviations are put in brackets):—

Common Weight (avoir.)
- 16 grams = 1 ounce (oz.)
- 16 ounces = 1 pound (lb.) = 7,000 grains
- 112 pounds = 1 hundredweight (cwt.)
- 2,240 pounds = 1 ton
- 14 pounds = 1 stone (used in speaking of a man's weight)

Troy Weight
- 24 grains = 1 pennyweight (dwt.)
- 20 pennyweights = 1 ounce (oz.)
- 12 ounces = 1 pound (lb.) = 5,760 grains

Both pounds, ounces and pound, ounce are used for the plural, but now it is much more common to say pounds, ounces, while stone is more common than stones for the plural (He weighs twelve stone / a man of twelve stone).

Notice that in all expressions of weight, size, value, distance, we use the terms of measure immediately after the vbb. weigh, measure, cost and the adj. worth.

The package weighs a pound and half.
It costs three dollars.
It is worth the money.
It is not worth sixpence.
The bed measures six feet long.

Compare also expressions of time and number like It lasts seven minutes, The troops numbered fifteen thousand and also the expressions, weighs heavy, weighs much, weighs little, is worth much, is worth little, cost dear, measure long, measure short, etc.

### 6.30. Expressions of Value.
In English, there are two different ways of counting money, the English and the American way. The English way is really as complicated as, and only a little less crazy than, the Chinese way of counting dollars and taels and "big money" and "small money." However, there are only three chief units to learn, as follows:—

- 1 penny = about 2 gold cents
- 12 pence = 1 shilling = about 25 cts. Gold
- 20 shillings = 1 pound = about $5.00 Gold

Crown and sovereign are names of English coins.
- 1 crown = 5 shillings
- 1 halfcrown = 2 shillings and sixpence
- 1 sovereign = 1 pound

The symbols used are:—
- £. s. d. = pound—shilling—pence
- £6.10.6. = six pound ten and six (ten shillings and sixpence)
- £3 = three pounds
- 10/6 = ten and six (ten shillings and sixpence)
- 4/- = four shillings
- 1/- = one shilling
- 8d. or -/8 = eightpence

The terms pound and penny require special notice.
- five pounds (-s usual)
- five pound ten (without -s)
- five pounds sterling (sterling used only with exact sums of pounds, as £500 stg., but not "five pound ten stg.")
- pennies (plural as regards coins)
- pence (plural as regards sum or value)
- halfpenny (pr. ['heipni])
- twopence (pr. ['tæpns])
- threepence (pr. ['θri:pns])
- twopenny piece (pr. ['tæpəni])
- threepenny piece (pr. ['θri:pəni])
- fourpence to elevenpence and twentypence written together (pr. [-pns])—otherwise written separately (pr. [pens]), e.g., thirteen pence

The American dollar-and-cents system is like the Chinese.

- 100 cents (cts.) = 1 dollar ($1.00)
- 10 cents = 1 dime
- 5 cents = 1 nickel

For the following symbols read as follows:—
- $1.00 (U.S.) : one dollar U.S. currency
- $1.00 G.     : one dollar gold
- $1.50        : dollar fifty, or dollar and half
- $3.75        : three (dollars) seventy-five (cents)

The English terms for the Chinese currency are as follows:—
- $1.00 (Mex.)    : one dollar Mex. (or Mexican)
- ¥ 25 or 25 tls. : twenty-five taels
- 10 Hk. tls.     : ten Haikwan taels
- ¥ 0.03          : three tael cents
- 23 cop. or cops.: twenty-three coppers
- cash = 文; 現洋
- big money = 大洋
- small money = 小洋

Among the non-English foreign currencies, we may mention here the German mark (=25 cents Gold) and the French franc (=20 cents Gold). We speak also of paper mark, gold mark and paper franc, gold franc. Notice also expressions like a dollar's worth of salt-eggs, fifteen-cents' worth of sugar, a dollar note (banknote) and a five-pound note.

### 6.40. Expressions of Size and Distance.
There are also two systems here, the old English system and the metric system. In the metric system, the meter here is used as the basis, and the other names have prefixes like deca-, kilo-, deci-, milli-, which have the same meaning as in the "gram" series (cf. §6.20). The practically useful words here are:—

- meter = 39 inches, a little over a yard
- kilometer = 1,000 meters, about two-thirds of a mile
- centimeter = 100th of a meter, about 1/3 of an inch

In the old system, there are the following expressions:

- inch = 英寸, about 0.73 Chinese in.
- foot = 12 inches, about 8.7 Chinese in.
- yard = 3 feet = 2.6 Chinese ft.
- mile = 1,760 yds., about 3.3 Chinese li
- furlong = 220 yds., or 8th of a mile
- fathom = 6 ft. or 2 yds. (especially in measuring depth of water)
- 5′ 4″ = five feet four inches

For the plural, we almost always add an -s to these terms, except when they are used as modifiers, as in a five-foot shelf, a two-yard stick, three inch (or inches) wide. Learn also the following expressions of size, and surface and cubic measures:—

- four square feet (4 sq. ft.) = four squares, each of which is one foot long and one foot wide; three sq. ft. = three such squares = 三方尺
- four feet square = a square whose sides are all four feet long = 四尺見方
- square mile = 方哩
- acre = 4,840 sq. yds. = 英畝 (the Chinese mow is a highly shifting measure)
- three feet long by four feet wide, or three by four (often written 3′×4′)
- four cubic feet = 四立方尺
- twenty cubic centimeters

Notice that we can say a thing is the size of . . . , is twice (half) the size of . . . Notice also that we very commonly say A man is a hundred yards off, The water is four inches deep, using a hundred yards and four inches as adverb phrases, and the word off as an adjective.

Exercise 44. Learn to use the following expressions:—

1. five feet high
2. five feet four
3. three inches deep (thick)
4. eight by ten
5. a few steps from here
6. a hundred paces from
7. quarter of a mile
8. miles and miles away
9. a long (short) way off
10. a long (short) distance from
11. within sight
12. within call
13. at a stone's throw
14. within a bowshot
15. within an earshot
16. by a long way
17. near at hand
18. about a hundred yards off
19. three blocks further (cross three streets)
20. the size of a pea
21. the height of a lamp-post
22. the thickness of this book
23. about an hour's walk from
24. ten minutes' ride from
25. near (close) by a place

### 6.50. Expressions of Shape: English Shape-Blindness.
A great difference is noticeable when we compare the English and Chinese notions of shape. Whereas the Chinese seem unable to think of a thing without calling up its shape also, the English language, looked at from the purely Chinese point of view, seems to be spoken by a race of shape-blind people. This is another instance of the highly concrete and synthetic way of Chinese thinking.

English suffices with a fish, a table, a bookcase, an ox, etc. But in Chinese, we have, for instance:—

- 一條魚 i t'iau yu (one "strip" fish)
- 一張桌子 i chang chuo-ts (one "flat piece" table)
- 一架書櫥 i chia shu-ch'u (one "shelf" book-case)
- 一頭牛 i t'ou niu (one "head" ox)
- 一座山 i tsuo shan (one "seat" hill)
- 一把刀 i pa tao (one "grip" knife)
- 一管筆 i kuan pi (one "tube" brush)
- 一盞燈 i chan teng (one "small-cup" lamp)
- 一灣溪水 i wan ch'i-shui (one "curve" river)
- 一鉤新月 i kou hsin-yueh (one "hook" new moon)

There are times when this shape-notion is carried so far as to apply to abstract things even, as in the following:—

- 一門親事 i men ch'in shih (one "door" marriage)
- 一團晦氣 i t'uan huet-ch'i (one "lump" depressed spirit)
- 一腔熱誠 i ch'iang jeh-ch'eng (one "throat" enthusiasm)
- 一場惡夢 i ch'ang o meng (one "scene" bad dream)
- 一股勇氣 i ku yung-ch'i (one "bunch" courage)
- 一道命令 i tao ming-ling (one "path" official order)

This way of thinking, however, although not common in English, is not entirely absent in that language. When a chorus girl,* under the fire of the prosecutor's questions in a court trial, cries out in desperation: "Oh, won't you leave me one shred of my reputation?!" she is using there a phrase implying a very vivid shape-notion. Notice also the following:—

- a cake of soap
- a bar of soap
- a ball of cotton yarn
- a sheet of paper
- a drop of water
- a grain of sand, rice, justice
- a piece of mutton, hair, paper, luck
- a strip of land, cloth, paper
- a ray of hope
- a shower of criticism
- a sea of trouble
- an expanse of water

*Mary Dugan in the play The Trial of Mary Dugan.

- a cloud of arrows
- a car of corn
- a lump of sugar
- a bit of water, honey, food, paper
- a slice of bread
- 20 head of cattle

Compare also the expressions for collective nn. and mass-words, as a bunch of grapes, a suit of clothing, a jar of honey, etc. (see §§ 5.11, 5.23).

### 6.60. Expressions of Position.
Position is usually indicated in English by prepp. and advv., as well as by adjj. It should be remembered, however, that the relationship between prepp. and advv. is very close and the distinction between them is often purely arbitrary:—

- [Adj.] He is in.
- [Adv.] He goes in.
- [Prep.] He is in the house.

There are few prepp. that cannot otherwise serve as adjj. or advv. in identical or similar senses:

| Prep.               | Adj.                | Adv.                |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| up the river        | he is up            | going up            |
| off the coast       | mind is off         | goes off            |
| by his side         | by-path             | passes by           |
| inside the room     | people inside       | goes inside         |
| above your head     | man above           | stay above          |
| below him           | man below           | look below          |
| under the water     | under-log           | go under (sink)     |
| between them        | a layer between     | came between        |
| over the top        | meeting is over     | talk it over        |
| about this point    | is about to         | turn about          |

In up train, man below (above), we may regard the words up and below as originally advv. used as adjj, like then in the then (reigning) king. We say also "His visits home are few and far between": the advv. home and between are here used as adjj. It is important, therefore, that we recognize the close relationship between prepp. and advv. and adjj. of place or position. Study how the words far, near, with, without, besides, beside, away are used. Can all of them be used as prepp.?

It is even clearer that all prepositional phrases are used in adj. or adv. functions. These phrases are called "prepositional phrases" as regards their form (beginning with a prep.), and "adj." or "adv. phrases" as regards their function:—

He came into the house (adv. modifying came).
He is in the house (adj. modifying he).

It is also interesting to note that (a) adjj. of position are often used as nn. and that we often have (b) a prep. + an adv., or (c) an adv. + a prep., or prep. + prep. (=compound prep.), the distinction between adv. and prep. here being, as we have said, arbitrary. Up to, down in, on to, e.g., are clearly compound prepp. like upon, into, unto.

(a)
- the above
- the next
- the last
- the rear
- the front
- the east
- the west
- to the right
- on the left

(b)
- over here
- over there
- round here
- from above
- from on high (=from above)
- from abroad

(c)
- down in the room
- up from slavery
- in between them
- on with it (開始進行)
- away with the old
- on to the new
- jump on to the stage
- get down from the car
- run up to the house
- look up to the man
- look down upon him
- from within
- from behind the forest
- out from a place
- get on with a fellow
- up to the present

Notice also such common pairs as the following:—

- over and above
- around and above us
- to and fro
- back and forth
- right and left
- here and there
- round and round
- on and on
- in and out
- off and on

All of these are usually used as adv. phrases.

### 6.61. Peculiar Use of Prepositions.
One of the greatest difficulties for a foreign student of English is the use of proper prepositions. This is so because, perhaps more than any other class of words, the use of prepositions depends on usage alone. This usage varies from word to word, and from language to language. It is quite clear that we should say "The ship floats on water," but it is not so clear why we should say "The house is on fire," and not "in fire." Usage alone determines this, and usage varies in the different languages. We say "in bed" in English, but tsai ch'uang shang ("on bed") in Chinese.

In English, vbb. and adjj. often require definite prepp. in particular senses. These prepp. combine with their preceding vbb. or adjj. to form phrases with a definite meaning. Thus to "wait for" means to await, whereas to "wait on" means to serve or attend upon a person. The use of prepp. after vbb. and adjj., therefore, must be closely observed, and this is always indicated in a good dictionary. Study, for example, the following phrases, and notice the change of meaning and the entirely arbitrary nature in the use of prepp.

- on the train
- get on the horse
- house is on fire 着火
- dog is on the chain
- march on London 攻
- drew knife on me
- turn back on person 拒
- look on game 旁觀
- look at thing 看
- look upon something 視
- look into matter 勘查
- look up to person 景仰
- look down upon person 卑睨
- look over manuscript 閱
- look about 環顧
- look forward to 期望
- look back upon 回顧,追憶
- get at meaning
- get up from bed
- get on with friend
- get away from place
- get through with work
- get down to work
- get used to thing

The use of up and down in connexion with travelling is quite like Chinese. We say up north, but down south, and use up in general for going to a higher place, or capital, or university, and down for the opposite. The word around is gradually disappearing in British usage, and is being substituted by round. While Americans would say turn around, go around to the post, the church around the corner, loaf around a place, such expressions are already impossibilities for an Englishman. He would say round here, round the corner, seated round the table, stationed round the field.

Notions of concrete position naturally shade off into those of abstract relationships. For prepp. expressing relationships (angry with person, at thing), see Chap. XV.
