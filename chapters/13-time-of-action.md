## CHAPTER XIII TIME OF ACTION

### 13.10. The Time Scheme: Present, Past and Future

The usual division of time is into the three main classes: present, past and future, as represented by I saw, I see and I shall see. In each of these three main divisions, one can state that something has already taken place before it, and something is going to take place after it. Thus we get nine tenses altogether, as shown in the following scheme:

- Before-past: I had seen
- Simple past: I saw
- After-past: I was (going) to see

- Before-present: I have seen
- Simple present: I see
- After-present: I am going to see / I shall see

- Before-future: I shall have seen
- Simple future: I shall see / I am going to see
- After-future: I shall be going to see

Notice that there is an overlapping in the central division "present." "Before-present" is really past, and "after-present" is really future. In English, the distinction between before-present and past is preserved through the forms I saw and I have seen, whereas in French, for instance, "I have seen" (j'ai vu) is regularly used for the past. Whether the grammatical distinction is maintained or not, the action itself really took place in the past. On the other hand, the after-present and the future really come together in English, because what comes after the present is naturally in the future. However, a slight distinction is noticeable. There is a difference between I am going to do it now or I shall do it now (after-present) and I am going to do it tomorrow or I shall do it tomorrow (simple future).

Notice that, on account of the fact that the past of shall (should) has a non-temporal use (i.e., not pertaining to time proper), it is defective and cannot be used for the after-past and cannot alone form the after-future. On the other hand, the expression be going to gives us a perfect conjugation in all tenses. Actually, be going to is as important a form for expressing future action as shall or will.

Again, actions may last a long time. Hence, we get another scheme of durative tenses:

- Before-past: I had been seeing
- Past: I was seeing

- Before-present: I have been seeing
- Present: I am seeing

- Before-future: I shall have been seeing
- Future: I shall be seeing

In this case, what is before-present really started in the past and is continued down to the present. Before-future has very little actual use.

### 13.20. What is Present?

If we imagine time as flowing in a straight line, and try to fix the limit for the "present," we immediately see that it occupies an infinitesimal, ever-fleeting point of time only. Logically, that time we call present is just a bare second, whereas all that goes before it belongs to the past (even the last second) and all that comes after it belongs to the future (including the next second). It is because of this fact that the present always encroaches upon the territory of the past or the future. I have just seen him, nominally called the present, really indicates a past action, and I shall do it now indicates really that the action will take place in the future. It is, therefore, very difficult to "do" anything in the present. There are very few things that can be done in the present second. Hence, we practically never express really present action by the simple present, and use instead the present continuous: I am doing it now, which expresses an extended period. The result is, either we have done a thing, or are going to do it, or we are doing it right now. For fuller illustrations, see § 11.10.

### 13.21. Habitual Action and Eternal Truths

Actually, however, we do regard the present as something more than a mere point of time. We often mean by it today, or the present week, or even the present year. For instance, we say I am staying at the X Hotel this week, or We dine at eight this year, last year we dined at seven. The last example indicates not really present action, but merely a present habit. Or in the case of words like know, believe, think and be (I know you are right / I believe you are wrong), the suggestion is really that knowing or believing covers a long time. Or again, we may express an eternal truth when we say The earth moves around the sun, or at least a general statement when we say A carriage has four wheels / A hansom has two wheels / A statue stands in the yard / The Japanese eat a lot of beans and fish / Bread is made from flour / If you take the plug off, the current is cut off / There is not enough ventilation in this room. For this reason, we see that the simple present in English is used to express habitual actions like know and love that cover a long time, and eternal truths or general statements. But it is never used to express really present action. When a man is killing a boy unintentionally, say to him, "You are killing the boy!" and not "You kill the boy!" although the killing may take only a fraction of a second. (See §11.10.)

### 13.30. Expression of Future

Future action differs from present action in that it has not yet actually taken place, and hence the action is not an accomplished fact, but a wish, an obligation, a possibility or an expectation merely: He will go / He shall go / He may go / He expects to go. There is always more or less an element of uncertainty or intention in it. The purest form is what we call "simple future": He will die soon, or He is going to die soon. These forms may be arranged under the following heads:

(1) Simple future: I shall come again / He will die soon.
(2) Intention: I will come again.
(3) Command: Come! / You shall come this afternoon.
(4) Possibility: I may come again.
(5) Obligation: I am to see him this afternoon.

### 13.31. "Shall" and "Will"

The English shall and will seem to cause a great deal of difficulty among Chinese students. The clearest and simplest explanation is to arrange them under the three heads: command, intention and simple future.

SIMPLE FUTURE                     COMMAND
I shall          we shall          Always shall
you will         you will
he }                               INTENTION
she } will        they will        Always will
it }

As examples of COMMAND, we have: You shall be punished for this / He shall be kept indoors / Each one shall have two eggs for his breakfast / You shan't see her again. As no one gives commands to himself, therefore the forms I shall, we shall are not found in the sense of commands. Instead of we shall, the form let's is used: Let's go.

As examples of INTENTION, we have: I will come again / They will come tonight / He has decided that he will not stay here any longer.

As examples of SIMPLE FUTURE, we have: I shall be going soon / I shall be away tomorrow / You will be sorry for this / The school will close soon / It will rain soon / Tomorrow will be Saturday / It will be impossible to do anything tonight.

In asking questions, use the word which you expect in the answer.

Shall you be here tonight?       I shall.
Will you come again?            I will.
Shall they come, too?           They shan't.
Shall I tell him?               Do. (You shall.)
Will he die?                   I'm afraid he will.

The important thing is to form the habit of using I shall and we shall for simple future instead of I will (and shall I? in questions instead of will I?). Say I shall not be able to and not I will not be able to, because this is simple future, for be able is not something that you can "will." There is a tendency in modern English to use I'll for I shall (indicating simple future), because I'll is shorter and easier to pronounce: as I am afraid I'll die soon (strictly I shall). This is especially true of American and Scotch usage. But one should nevertheless form the habit first of following the correct usage of using I shall.

Will and shall are usually pronounced [l] and [ʃeːl] or [ʃ-ːl] respectively: I'll [ail], he'll [hiːl], they'll [ðeil], I shall [ai ʃel]. Shan't is pronounced with a clear [ɑː]: You shan't [ʃɑːnt] do this. There is a special use of will, meaning "insist," which is always pronounced full [wil].

I told him not to go, but he will go (i.e., he insists on going).
Boys will be boys (i.e., you can't expect boys to behave like grown-ups).
But things will happen against our wish.

Also as a full vb. (not as an auxiliary), will is pronounced full: God wills (willed) [wilz (wild)] that it should be so.

Exercise 102. Fill in shall or will in the following sentences expressing simple future:

1. They say he —— be promoted soon.
2. No one —— be able to stop him.
3. I am afraid I —— not be here tonight.
4. Who —— speak at tonight's dinner?
5. —— he take part in the contest?
6. I —— not dare to tell him.
7. If we are caught, we —— all be sent to prison.
8. —— we stay away very long?
9. —— we go very far?
10. The matter —— be settled soon.

### 13.32. Chinese "Chiang" and "Yao"

The distinction between simple future and intention is best illustrated through their Chinese equivalents. Chiang (将) and chiu (就) and originally the meaning of "going," "going near" and "following," like the English going to, and like going to they are used to indicate simple future. It is going to rain (simple future) is easily translated by 将 (要) 下雨了 and 就 (要) 下雨了. It will be finished soon, or It is going to be finished soon (simple future) is easily translated by 就 (要) 完了. (This is true also of the French language, where "I am going to come," je vais venir, is used to express simple future.)

The word yao (要) originally expresses intention. 他要來不要來? = Will he come or not (is it his intention)? But like will in English, it also takes on another meaning indicating no intention, but simple future: He will die soon = 他快要死了.

### 13.33. "May" and "Is to"

Shall and will (with be going to) cover the three usual expressions of future action: simple future, command and intention. Two other forms, possibility and obligation, are usually expressed by may and be to. Thus He may or may not come and I may go away tomorrow are as much forms of expressing future action as I will go or You shall go tomorrow. Notice also that we say I hope he will go and I hope he may go, both indicating future action.

As a way of expressing future obligation, is to is often more useful than shall. Even in commands, You are to hand in the exercises next Monday is as often used as You shall hand in, etc. Where several subjects are designated, is to is probably more convenient than shall: The first year students are to enter first, and the second year students are to follow them (instead of students shall, etc.). Also in stating that something was going to take place in some past time (after-past), was to, instead of should, is the correct expression. The ship was to arrive that afternoon (not ship should) means that the ship had not yet arrived at that past time, but was going to arrive.

Exercise 103. Translate the following from Chinese into English:

1. 明天也許他不在家。
2. 也許明天他不見了，這是很可能的事。
3. 這齣戲 (play) 成功不成功不一定。
4. 子路應在前走，子貢應跟着他。
5. 我就走了，因為我還要去看幾位朋友。（過去）
6. 那天下午正要開學。
7. 你們一聽號角 (whistle)，就得齊集操場 (playground) 上。

### 13.34. Present Used for Future

In English, the present is used for expressing future action under two circumstances. First, the vbb. expressing the idea of "going" or "moving" are often used this way. Thus for I shall come, we simply say I am coming (tomorrow or next week), and not I am going to come. I am going and I am coming therefore really express future action (compare I am thinking, I am working now). Further examples are:

I leave tomorrow for Peiping.
The ship sails next Saturday.
He starts this afternoon.
You are not going to tonight's meeting, are you?
He is going away this summer.
He is coming back next autumn.

Secondly, in all clauses implying supposition, the present is used for the future. We say, If it rains tonight, I shall not go (never if it will rain tonight).

Give him my best regards when you see him.
By the time you return, there will be nothing left.
Don't wait for me for supper, if I don't come back before seven.
If you do this again (or If this happens again), you shall be duly punished.
Tell him to wait for me, in case he calls.
When he graduates from college, he will be twenty-two.

### 13.40. Past Actions Are Facts

Much more than ninety-nine per cent of the events in this world took place in the past. Hence it is that the past forms of vbb. are most frequently used in stating facts. In this sense, the past constitutes the exact opposite of the future, which expresses a wish, a possibility or at most an expected event (see above § 13.30). When we say He killed a man, we mean that the murder is already an established fact, but when we say He will kill a man, it is only a surmise, and even I will kill you constitutes nothing but a threat in the eye of the law.

### 13.41. Use of the Past

Because past actions are facts, the most common use of the past is in reporting events. Whole shelves of history may be written in the past tense with the exception of the dialogues and the writer's opinions of incidental remarks. In making reports, scientific or otherwise, the past tense should always be used. The following is an example of a proper scientific report:

"When the Congress of the Behaviourists assembled on the third day, a public experiment was carried out in the presence of the delegates and the local university professors to test the ability of pigs to distinguish artificial pearls from real ones. Two professors were in charge of the pigs in the yard, properly numbered from one to twenty-four. After the President called the meeting to order, Professor Lavinsky led Pig No. One by the right ear to a square previously marked. A thermometer was put in the pig's mouth, and the professor's assistant listened with a stethoscope held close to the subject's sides in order to observe its heart reactions, while a string of artificial pearls was held forth about thirty centimeters from the pig's snout for thirty minutes. After the reactions, if any, were properly recorded, a string of genuine pearls was produced at the same distance, and the subject's reactions were observed and recorded in the same manner. The number of gruntings was also recorded. The experiment was applied in identical manner to all the twenty-four subjects. After the complete series of experiments was carried out, and the records showed no noticeable difference in the subjects' reactions to real and artificial pearls, the Congress unanimously came to the conclusion that pigs are [eternal truth or general statement] not capable of distinguishing between real and artificial pearls of the kinds used. The meeting was adjourned at 12.30."

Another very common use of the past which should be noticed by Chinese students is in the form of phrases like I knew, I thought, I didn't know, I didn't quite realize, I forgot, which are forms for expressing a previous thought or idea, usually given up at present. I thought is the same as 我以為 and implies that I do not think so now. I knew = 我早知道, means I knew this before it happened. About the same idea is expressed by I told you long ago. These forms are very useful.

I knew you would do it. (A way of approval, when a man has consented to do something after your persuasion.)
I knew he couldn't do it. (I am a very wise man.)
I thought you didn't want me to come along. (A good excuse.)
Oh, I didn't know you had a friend here. (Excuse for intrusion.)
I thought you had decided to cut out smoking. (Gentle remonstration.)
I thought you were an honest man. (Sarcastic remark.)
I thought I was dealing with an honest man.
He thought he could get away with it. (Now he knows he can't: said with some satisfaction.)
That was what I thought, too. (I shared the mistake.)
I told you long ago not to believe him. (But you would not believe me until it is too late.)
I forgot to tell you that A wasn't coming.

### 13.42. Past Visualized: "Dramatic Present"

In telling stories, especially in passages of vivid description, the present tense is often used for what is known to be past events. The writer and the reader are supposed to be so absorbed in the account that the events seem to take place before their eyes. This is called the "dramatic present." E.g.—

Achilles is so angered by the death of his friend Patroclus that he changes his mind. He swears that his friend's death must be avenged.
So Achilles once more appears before his camp. With a great shout, he enters the battle. The Greeks are overjoyed to see their hero again, while the Trojans gird themselves for a severe battle.
Achilles sees Hector, and the two close in combat. Hard and furiously the two great warriors fight against one another, while around them the battle rages. The Trojan women look on from the ramparts with breathless excitement, for it is the greatest battle they have ever witnessed. Back and forth the tide of battle turns. Spear clashes with spear, and shield with shield, while the noise of chariots and horses and men's war-cries and women's shrill voices are heard in the general confusion.

At last, Achilles's spear pierces through Hector's body. The great Trojan falls. A great shout goes up from the soldiers of Agamemnon and rends the sky. The Trojan women are seized with fear and bitter sorrow. Some weep and some wail, while Hector's own mother and sister stand quietly, silent as death.

In his fury, Achilles takes off the helmet of Hector, and binding his dead body to the chariot, he drives it around the city wall, with Hector's head trailing in the dust. Three times Achilles drives his chariot around the city, while the Trojans look on aghast and terrified.

It is a great day for the Greeks, and towards evening, there is great rejoicing in their camps.

### 13.43. Tense in Dependent Clauses

Generally, if the main vb. of the sentence is in the past tense, the vbb. of the dependent clauses must be in the past tense also. Thus we say: Barker said (main vb.) that he was coming (dependent clause) / It was reported (main vb.) that Mr. Soong was going to resign (dependent clause). For full study of this use and examples, see § 7.61.

### 13.50. Irregular Verbs

The present, the past and the past participle are called the three "principal parts" of a vb. A regular vb. forms its past and p.p. by adding -ed, as return, returned (p.), returned (p.p.). In English, there are a good number of vbb. (among them, some very common ones, like come, go, speak, write, stand, sit, etc.), which do not form their past and p.p. this way and which are, therefore, called "irregular." The irregularity is due to historical development from earlier Indo-Germanic forms, while a great number of regular vbb. today were originally irregular. English vbb. from Latin or French sources are always regular (return, commence, cease, remember), while all irregular vbb. are original Germanic words (with related forms in modern German, Dutch, Danish, and Scandinavian).

For practical purposes, it is only necessary to study these vbb. under three heads: (a) those having one form, (b) those having two, and (c) those having three.

(a) Some vbb. do not change at all or have only one form.

Present          Past           P.P.
bet              bet            bet
burst            burst          burst
cast             cast           cast
cost             cost           cost
cut              cut            cut
hit              hit            hit
hurt             hurt           hurt
let              let            let
put              put            put
set              set            set
shut             shut           shut
slit             slit           slit
split            split          split
sweat            sweat          sweat
thrust           thrust         thrust
rid              rid            rid
shed             shed           shed
spread           spread         spread

Notice that all these are monosyllabic words, with a final t (except rid, etc.). One never says hitted, cutted, setted. On the other hand, we have two alternate forms, knit and knitted, wed and wedded, quit and quitted for both the past and the p.p.

(b) We have vbb. with two forms, the past and p.p. being similar. Among these vbb., the p.p. never ends in -n (except beaten, which really belongs under "c"). Those marked with an asterisk (*) have also regular past and p.p. with -ed.

Present          Past           P.P.

NOTES. (1) Hanged as past and p.p. is used in the sense of "hanging a man to death;" hung is used in the other senses.
(2) Sung and sprung are not in modern use for past tense.
(3) The auxiliaries can, may, will and shall have only two forms (present and past, but no p.p.). These will be studied in § 13.60.

(c) Finally we have vbb. which have three forms in the three principal parts. With the exception of the words begin and swim (which are nearer the words in "b"), these vbb. are always distinguished by the fact that they have their p.p. ending in -n.

Present         Past         P.P.

NOTES. (1) The last p.pp. marked with an asterisk have one form ending in -en. These forms are used chiefly (though not exclusively) as modifiers preceding nn., while the other forms without the -en ending are used as parts of a verbal tense. E.g.—

A graven image.                     Image has been (en)graved.
Molten iron.                        Iron is melted.
A proven or proved theory.          Theory has not been proved.
A clean-shaven face.                Have you shaved yet?
A shorn lamb.                       Lamb's wool has been sheared.
A forgotten incident.               I have forgot (or forgotten) it.
Ill-gotten money.                   What have you got?
A sunken bell.                      The ship was sunk.
A drunken fellow.                   He was dead drunk.
A disease-stricken district.        I was quite struck by her beauty.
Your bounden duty.                  That is bound to happen.
A hidden word.                      Where have you hidden yourself? (hid rare)
God's only begotten son.            Laziness is begotten of the devil.
A shrunken face.                    The cloth has shrunk.
The swine's cloven hoof (only in this sense; otherwise cleft: a cleft roof).

(2) Distinguish carefully between the v.t. lay (lay a book down) and the v.i. lie (I lie in bed); also between the regular load and the irregular lade:—

lay [放]           laid             laid
lie [臥]           lay              lain
lade (rare)        lade (rare)      laden } 意同
load               loaded           loaded

(3) Distinguish between the p.p. borne (The whole burden is borne by him) and the p.p. born (A baby is born).
(4) Notice that flow and welcome are perfectly regular, although fly and come (also become) are irregular.

fly [飛]            flew             flown
flow [流]           flowed           flowed
come                came             come
welcome             welcomed         welcomed

Welcome is used as an adj. in You are welcome / He is welcome to say what he pleases.

(5) Distinguish between see and saw:—

see [看]           saw            seen
saw [鋸]          sawed          sawn

(6) Distinguish between the regular waken, awaken and the irregular wake, awake. All four words are used both as vv.t. and as vv.i., and all four mean about the same thing. Wake and waken are usually connected with up (I wake up, I waken up / wake him up, waken him up), while awake and awoken are not.

awake              awoke          awoke, awaked
wake               woke, waked    woken, waked
awaken             awakened       awakened
waken              wakened        wakened

### 13.60. Might, Could, Would, Should and Ought

The past forms of the auxiliaries may, can, will and shall are, of course, might, could, would and should. In addition, there is the auxiliary ought, which is the past form of the vb. owe. The use of these words should be specially studied.

(1) They are used as past forms in dependent clauses. When we transform a direct statement like "He said, 'I will come.'" into an indirect statement, we have to substitute would for will: He said that he would come.

I didn't know what I should do (= was to do) at the moment.
He said he would be coming in a week.
You didn't think he could do it, did you?
I thought he might want to leave his home for a change.
The doctor said that a week's rest should do him a lot of good.
So I asked him to get the money ready, and he said that it should be arranged.

(2) They are used to indicate something which is not true or which has not happened at present, especially in connexion with I wish.

I wish you would not talk like that. (You are talking in a very rude manner.)
I wish I could go away for a vacation. (The fact is, I can't.)
He thinks that he might be able to get the job (which he hasn't got yet).
It would be a great pity to lose his service at the present moment. (Actually, he has not resigned yet.)
You ought to realize that this isn't a public playground.
I wish I could help you (but I can't).

(3) They are used with like, want, care, think, be able to, etc. as modified or weakened statements. I like states directly an open fact that I like, while I should like suggests a gentler, less decisive meaning. The latter form is generally used in preference to the former.

I should like to
I should think
You wouldn't want to
I shouldn't want to
I shouldn't care to
I should be able to

He might be able to
He might be willing to
I should love to
You would like to
He would want to
She would care to

I should think he must be there now.
I shouldn't think so.
You wouldn't want to play the whole afternoon.
I should be able to tell you something more definite, if, etc.
You should be able (You ought to be able) to do it.

(Review § 3.67 for a fuller discussion of this use.)

(4) The most common use of these past forms is as auxiliaries indicating a general supposition, without reference to time. Do you suppose that he could do it? means: is he the kind of man to do such a thing, whether now or at any time? If you put a lamb and a hungry lion together in the same room, what do you think would happen? The lion would eat up the lamb, of course. This is true at any time, and does not refer to the past or the present. We may say that would is used here to indicate a general tense.

The ideal thing would be for a man to marry at about twenty-five and for a girl to marry at about twenty-two.
That would be the best arrangement.
Any one could do it.
No one could do two things well at a time.
General Chang Tsung-chang believes that a girl should be shut up in her house and should never appear in a public park.
He is a very sensitive man, and if you tell (or: should tell) him that he has got a loose button, he might be offended.
In order to bring about a new China, we should begin from the provinces, or in fact the villages.
The best thing would be for everybody to go back to his province or his town and begin reform at home.
Aspirin could be taken whole or dissolved in a glass of water.
I wouldn't marry that girl, if she was worth a million.

Exercise 104. (A) Make sentences with I should like, I should think, etc.

(B) The use of should, would, etc. to indicate a general supposition is a most important habit to form in learning English. Avoid the following direct statements and change them into statements of general supposition:

1. If you take away his books, he has nothing to do and he sits the whole day without saying a word.
2. I like to be an engineer.
3. Is there a chance for me?
4. If you don't look out, you fall down.
5. He will not listen to his friends' advice.
6. We two may pay him a surprise visit
7. Do you dare to go out in a pink pyjama?
8. It is best to let him alone.
9. Do you care to come?
10. Do you like to come along?
11. I'm afraid that is a little difficult.

### 13.61. Expression of the Past with Auxiliaries

On account of the fact that the past forms would, should, could and might are usually used to express general time, a definite form for expressing the past with these auxiliaries (including may, must and ought) has been created by putting the principal vb. in the perfect tense. Thus we have He could do it (general tense), but He could have done it (past tense).

I may have seen it.
It must have been a mistake.
Some one must have told you.
You should have prepared your lesson.
It would have been all right, if, etc.
If the other banks had not helped, that bank would have failed.
Who could have done this?
You may have heard the story before.
You should have heard him talk at the dinner.
I should have run away.
You should have resigned.
He could not have seen me, because he was not there.

Exercise 105. These phrases are extremely important. Learn to make sentences with should have, could have, may have, might have, must have. Fill in the blanks in the following sentences:

1. He had a car and five servants in his house. So he must have —— a rich man.
2. How could you stand such a man for so long? If I were you, I should have ——.
3. He knew all about it. Some one must have —— him.
4. You kept us all waiting for an hour. At least you might have —— us.
5. He must have —— this before.
6. He suddenly left without telling any one of us. I think he must have ——.

### 13.62. Declinable Substitutes for the Auxiliaries

Because will, shall, must, can have become auxiliaries, these words are not declinable, i.e., they do not have a full conjugation. There is, for instance, no past for must (He must go yesterday is not English). Modern English, however, has developed substitutes for these words, which can be expressed in any tense like other vbb. These substitutes are in every way as commonly used as the auxiliaries themselves: thus I am going to tell him is just as common a way of expressing future as I will (or shall) tell him. We have, then—

shall or will = be going to
can = be able to
must = have to

Be Going to

Past     I was going to see him.
Present  I am going to see him.
Future   I shall be going to see him.

Be Able to

Past     I was able to pay him.
Present  I am able to pay him.
Future   I shall be able to pay him.

Have to

Past     I had to pay him.
Present  I have to pay him.
Future   I shall have to pay him.

Moreover, the future of past is expressed by was going to or was to. We were to hold a meeting that afternoon means that the meeting had not been held yet, but it was decided that a meeting should be held that afternoon. We say: The ship was to arrive the next morning, and not The ship should (past form of shall), etc.

Exercise 106. Make sentences with the following:

I shall have to
You will have to
He had to
We were to
I shan't be able to
He won't be able to

He was going to
I am not going to
The meeting was going to
The next athletic meet is going to
No one will be able to
Miss Li was to

### 13.70. Conjunctions Expressing Time

Among these conjj., some express sequence of time (before, after), and some express contemporaneity (when, while). Before and after are quite simple. The use of others will be illustrated below:

(1) Not until. Some Chinese students say I will buy a new hat until money comes, meaning 等錢來了, 我要買一頂帽子. The Chinese teng (等) cannot be translated this way. Either say: I will buy nothing until money comes, or I will buy something when money comes.

Now can you forgive him?—Not until he makes an apology.
Not until the problem of militarists is solved, will there be any solution of the economic problems of China.
I will stay (or: I will not go away) until (or till) his mother comes.
We sat up last night till (or until) one o'clock. We did not go to bed till (or until) one o'clock.
We will keep on (will not change) until the proper time comes.
No one will be able to know the truth until the wounded man returns to consciousness.
Until you told me I had no idea of it.

(2) No sooner than, as soon as, directly, the moment.

No sooner had he finished his last sentence than the audience stood up. As soon as he finished, etc.
No sooner did I save up a few hundred dollars than some of my relatives fell sick or died. As soon as I saved up, etc.
The moment you leave the office, everybody starts talking, smoking and doing anything but attending to his duties.
Directly (or: As soon as) you leave, etc.
Immediately he went away, some burglars went into his house and stole many things.
There will be a great sensation, immediately (or: directly or as soon as) this news is spread abroad.

(3) While and when. Notice that we just as often attach while or when to the second clause as to the first in an English sentence. We were talking together when he entered the room is probably more idiomatic than When we were talking together, he entered the room. (cf. Chinese 我們在講話之時他進來, but not 我們講話在他進來之時). In any case, a when- or while-clause often stands at the end of an English sentence, while it seldom does so in Chinese. The English proverb says, "Make hay while the sun shines," and not "While the sun shines, make hay." When is often used like which for adding comments (§ 9.62).

You may just as well finish this up while you are waiting (or: while you have nothing else to do).
I have no time to do any reading until I come back from office, when I am usually too tired. (Comment)
Why do you have to be an official when you can make much more honest money in business?
I often go to see him, when I have nothing to do.
When a man is out of job, he will do anything for a living.
What's the use of staying in office, when you can't do what you wanted to do for China?
Don't wait until they dismiss you, when it will be too late. (Comment)
I like to do my writing at midnight, when all is quiet around me, and nobody calls and no telephone rings. (Comment)
The Marshal goes to bed at seven in the morning, when everybody is getting up, and gets up at seven in the afternoon, when everybody is about ready to go to bed. (Comment)
You can't rebuild the whole China, when you can't even rebuild the Chinese native city of Shanghai.

Notice that when and while are often used to express a relationship not pertaining to time proper.

He is very short, while she is very tall.
He is dark, while his wife is very fair.
While (Although) it is true that he never visited China, he knew Chinese philosophy very well from the study of the classics.
While (Although) you cannot have exactly what you wish, you have gained something that you did not expect.
A ought to keep his promise, while B ought to help to make it possible for him to keep his promise.
Why do you remain with him, when he does not care about you and does not even support you?

Exercise 107. Make some sentences, using when for making comments and while meaning "on the other hand" or "although."

### 13.80. Adverbs of Time

The following is a list of the most typical advv. or adverbial phrases indicating time. Notice that we use after three days, three days after, three days before and three days ago for the past, while we use in three days, in a week, in a minute generally for the future: I shall come back in a minute. (He finished it in a week has a different meaning.) Notice also that there is a difference between always and often, both of which are usually translated by the Chinese word ch'ang (常). He is always like that should be strictly translated by "他老是這樣" and He is often like that should be translated by "他常這樣." Presently does not mean at present, but by and by: I shall attend to this presently / Presently (Soon afterwards) he appeared again. Every and next are not preceded by prepp.—every time, next Wednesday, next month.

- most of the time
- often seldom
- ever, never
- once in a while
- once in a blue moon
- now and again
- sooner or later
- once a week, once a month
- on that day
- on Christmas Eve
- on Monday, on the 23rd
- this Monday (without prep.)
- every Monday (without prep.)
- next Monday (without prep.)
- at first, at last
- at night, at midday
- at sunrise, at sunset
- for ever, for good
- by that time (§ 11.62)
- for three whole days
- this time, (the) last time, next time, every time (without prep.)
- (a) week from today, or this day week (without prep.)
- Saturday week, a week from Saturday
- week after next
- presently, soon
- soon afterwards (past)
- three days after (past)
- after three days (past)
- some time ago (past)
- the other day (past)
- in a day or two
- in a minute
- wait a day, an hour, a minute (without prep.)

(For the use of prepp. indicating time in such adv. phrases, see § 11.62.)

Exercise 108. Make sentences with the above phrases, paying special attention to the use or omission of prepp.

### 13.90. Time in Nouns

Nn. do not, as a rule, involve any notion of time. There are, however, some cases like the following:

- her ex-husband
- the former president
- an ex-president
- the bride-to-be
- an ex-convict
- his mother-in-law-to-be
