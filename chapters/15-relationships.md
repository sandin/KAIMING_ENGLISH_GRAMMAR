## CHAPTER XV: RELATIONSHIPS

### 15.10. Conjunctions and Logical Relationships

The conjunctions in any language serve to bind the various parts of a sentence together. Grammatically speaking, they are the joints of the sentence structure. Notionally speaking, their function is to express the logical relationships. This latter view is broader and more comprehensive. We see, for instance, that English sentences often begin with conjj. like “and,” “therefore,” “but,” or “because”: “And I went away” / “Therefore I went away” / “But how can I do it?” / “(Why didn’t you go?) Because it was too late.” It would be easy to find their logical relationship with the preceding sentence, whereas it would not be so easy to establish their grammatical relationship with the same, because every sentence is supposed to be a separate unity.

### 15.20. Simple, Compound and Complex Sentences

The parts of a simple sentence may all be classified as shown in the following scheme:—

- Predicate
  - (1) Subject | (2) Principal Vb. \ (3) Object
  - (4) and (5) Modifiers which may be attached to any of the three parts above (and sometimes to one another)
    - Conjunctions
    - Adjectives
    - Adverbs
    - Nouns & Verbs (rarely), see §9.27.
    - Nouns in apposition, §8.40
    - Participles
    - Pronominal phrases (adj. or adv. phr.)
    - Infinitive phrases (adj. or adv. phr.)
    - Participial phrases (adj. phr.)

The above accounts for the structure of simple sentences. Interjections or exclamations are practically independent in their nature. In such simple sentences, conjj. are chiefly used to join modifiers: “I saw a good and handsome boy” / “He worked hard and fast.” The subject and principal vb. remain simple in nature.

Then we have another kind of sentence where we have either two subjects to one vb. (He and I went), or two vbb. to one subject (He came and went). Some grammars consider these already as compound sentences in contracted forms (=He came and he went / He went and I went contracted). But this has no practical meaning except for grammarians who are in the habit of classifying things.

Thirdly, we have real compound sentences, like the following:—

- He went away, so I came.
- I came, because he went away.
- Either you said so, or you didn’t.
- You broke it, therefore you must pay for it.
- He wanted to go, but he didn’t.

It is seen in the above that the conjj. so, because, etc. serve to connect two separate sentences into one, each part having its own subject and predicate.

So far, no clause has been introduced that is woven into another clause. He went away is clearly separate from I came. The moment we introduce a clause which is woven into another, or serves as part of its structure, we have what is called a complex sentence. For example—

- I didn’t say this. (Simple)
- I didn’t say that I wouldn’t go. (Complex: that I wouldn’t go serves as object in the main clause.)
- That is unknown to me. (Simple)
- How he did it is unknown to me. (Complex: noun clause as subject.)
- The man went away. (Simple)
- The man who was with you went away. (Complex: relative clause as modifier of man.)

In the above three examples of complex sentences, we have the conjj. that, how and the relative pron. who serving to connect the new clause with the original main clause.

A relative pron. is really only a conjunctive pron., just as a relative adv. (the time when, the place where) is only a conjunctive adv., because its function is to connect the new clause with something else, besides serving its regular function inside the relative clause.

### 15.30. Co-ordinate and Subordinate Clauses

In the complex sentences, it is clear that there is always one main or principal clause, and one or more subordinate or dependent clauses. The dependent clause is woven into, or dependent upon, the main clause, and is therefore rightly regarded as of lower rank. Thus in The man who was with you went away, the clause who was with you is dependent on the main clause The man went away.

But even in some compound sentences, we can distinguish between main and dependent clauses. In He came, but I went, both clauses are evidently of equal importance, and there is no main or dependent clause. But in He would come, if I would go, clearly the first clause (He would come) is the main statement, and if I would go describes only a condition of his coming. The second clause is therefore felt to be of less importance or lower rank than the first. Thus we can have a main clause and a dependent clause even in a compound sentence.

In such compound sentences, just what clause is considered main or dependent, and whether the two clauses are of equal or unequal importance depends entirely on the meaning. It cannot be judged from the grammatical form. Conj. like and, both, either . . . or, but, as well as, not only . . . but also naturally introduce co-ordinate clauses (of equal rank). On the other hand, conj. like if, because, although, since, in order that, so that, lest naturally introduce subordinate clauses (of lower rank).

Following are some illustrations of the difference between co-ordinate and subordinate clauses, as determined by their meaning (words in italics are conj. or conjugative phrases):—

**CO-ORDINATE CLAUSES (equal rank)**

- He was a thief, *and* she was the thief’s wife.
- This one is good, *but* that one is not.
- *Not only* is it possible, *but* it is also desirable to have him go with you.
- *Neither* is this mine, *nor* is it yours.
- This is all very well; *still*, it is not enough.
- The rich man becomes richer, *while* the poor man becomes poorer.
- She became very weak, *whereas* she had been very strong and healthy before her marriage.
- You must do as I say; *otherwise* (or: *or else*) I will have nothing to do with you.

**SUBORDINATE AND MAIN CLAUSES (unequal rank)**

- I will tell you, *if* you will promise not to tell any one.
- *Unless* you promise, I cannot tell it to you.
- We climbed over the top, *in order that* we might get a better view.
- He began to do his best, *lest* he should fail again.
- I said *that* he was no person to take up this business.
- *So long as* you persist, I will not give you any money.

### 15.40. Logical Relationships

All conj. express some kind of logical relationship. These relationships may be classified roughly under the following heads, under each of which, we shall examine the means of expressing them in English. The conjj. play the most important role, together with the conjunctive parts (relative pronn. and relative advv.). Prepositional and participial phrases are often employed instead of clauses introduced by conjj.; in fact, they are always shorter and therefore make the sentences simpler and easier to handle.

### 15.41. Combination

The commonest form of relationship is combination. And and both . . . and may connect any kinds of words or groups of words.

- He was [both] defeated and tired (combining adjj.).
- He played [both] fast and beautifully (advv.).
- We saw each other off and on (advv.).
- The arrow pierced into and through his chest (prepp.).
- I paid both for him and [for] his friends (prepp.).
- Both he and his wife escaped (subjects).
- He was strong and he was handsome (clauses).
- Men must work and women must weep (clauses).

Other similar relationships are expressed by as well as, not only . . . but (also), furthermore, besides, in addition, what is more, on top of that:—

- He, as well as his secretary, was found guilty.
- We not only dined together, but also danced together.
- Not only did we dine together, but we also danced together.
- It was not only unfair; it was contemptible.
- He was not only found guilty, but was also condemned to life imprisonment.
- The extra tax was a heavy burden on the people. Furthermore, it was against the orders of the Central Government.
- Besides (conj.), it is against my principles.
- Besides (prep.) giving him money and advice, he also bought the steamship ticket for him.
- I have, in addition, last month’s bills to pay.
- What is more, the prisoners were subjected to flogging and torture, in addition to poor food and unhygienic surroundings.
- On top of that, they were denied all intercourse with their friends.

### 15.42. Opposition

Probably the most useful conj. for expressing opposition is the word however. Other words and phrases are: but, while, whereas, far from, on the contrary, on the other hand, despite (prep.), in spite of (prep.) and the simpler prepp. contrary to and against. While but is the simplest and commonest in use, however is most useful both as a variation from but and as a conj. which could be placed in different parts of a sentence, thus making for a smoother and more flexible construction. Nevertheless is also very useful, conveying a deeper sense of contrast, while notwithstanding (prep.) is a little archaic.

- However, I am merely reporting this as a fact.
- This, however, is something different from what you said the other day.
- This is, however, something different, etc.
- This is something different, however, from what, etc.
- (For expressing a concession.—However much I may wish to help you, I can’t. See § 15.45.)
- But you said you could.
- While this position offers you honour and power, it imposes on you also a great responsibility.
- He claimed that opium had been completely suppressed in that district, while the facts are exactly to the contrary.
- Contrary to what he said, the growing of poppies has been systematically enforced upon the people against the people’s wish.
- In opposition to what you read in the newspapers, the prisoner has really never received a fair trial.
- Far from wishing him any ill, I have been offering him the best advice a friend can give.
- On the contrary, his expenses were all subsidized by the Japanese news agency.
- Far be it from me to criticize the government, who are my superiors.
- On the one hand, he took money from the Government, on the other hand, he was carrying on anti-government propaganda.
- On the other hand, there is this to be said for him.
- Despite (In spite of) repeated warnings, he went to Manchuria.
- She married him in spite of her father’s opposition (against her father’s wish).
- Nevertheless, she married.
- She married all the same.
- Notwithstanding all this, China’s internal administration has steadily improved.
- For all (In spite of all) your trouble, nothing has been gained or accomplished.

### 15.43. Selection and Substitution

For selection, we have either . . . or and neither . . . nor. Either may be used alone at the end of a clause or sentence, meaning “also.” Neither and nor may both be used alone at the beginning of sentences, meaning “also not.” For substitution, we have the phrases: instead of (prep.), in place of (prep.), otherwise, or, or else. Or has two meanings: (1) suggesting an alternative, = 或是, (2) = otherwise, 不然.

- You are either a fool or a knave.
- Either you are a fool or you are a knave.
- Either you are trying to deceive me, or you have been deceived yourself.
- Either he goes or I go (i.e., we cannot work together).
- Neither you nor anybody else can persuade him to give up writing poetry.
- God is neither here nor there.
- Neither of you knows the exact truth.
- Either of us (Either you or I) must go.
- You cannot do it. Neither (or Nor) can I. I cannot, either.
- You do as I say, or (=otherwise) out you go.
- You had better hurry, or (otherwise) you will be late.
- You can send him along, or else you can go yourself.
- Otherwise, how could he come in?
- Instead of being dressed up for dinner, he came down in his dressing gown.
- Instead of this, he took that. He took this instead of that.
- Instead of improving his service, he became worse.
- I came in his stead (or place).
- Instead of a Li Hung-chang, we have a graduate of Oberlin.
- In place of the old manager, we have a new boss in the person of McKinley.
- Government by law, instead of by personal privilege, is what we want.

### 15.44. Exclusion and Inclusion

The present participles excluding, excepting, including are placed at the beginning of clauses, while their passive forms (excluded, excepted, included) are always used after the words they modify. Except, excepting, and but are all used in the same sense, both as conjj. and as prepp. Except=除非. But for often appears as a phrase, meaning “except for”=如非. Too is more common and idiomatic in modern English than also. Both words may be used at the middle or end of sentences, while also often stands at the beginning.

- We have ten working days left this week, excluding the Sundays (or: the Sundays excluded).
- We will take in all applicants, foreigners (or: Chinese) excepted.
- Excepting for a little over-use of red and green, the painting is perfect.
- But for your help, I might have died.
- The hospital has a staff of thirty, including the nurses (=nurses included=with the nurses included).
- “I can resist everything except temptation,” says Oscar Wilde.
- When we arrived, we saw nothing except three persons sitting in the front row.
- That is true, too. This is also true.
- He came along, too. He, too, came along.
- He came also. He also came.
- Also (=Moreover), it must not be forgotten that he was born of Indian parents.
- That is also a good thing. That, also, is a good thing. That is a good thing, also.

### 15.45. Condition and Concession

If, providing, provided and on the condition that are used to express a condition. Though and although are used with very little difference to express a concession, as also granting and granted. At the beginning of sentences, although is more common than though. Granting, providing are less common than granted, provided, but mean the same as the latter words. The use of as and while in this sense should also be observed.

- Measles is not a dangerous disease, provided you keep the child in a closed room and maintain an even temperature.
- Many incurable diseases are really curable, providing (=if) you begin treatment early.
- Providing (or: Provided) everything goes off smoothly as we planned, there is no reason why you should not succeed.
- Although he is poor, he is honest.
- He is honest, though poor.
- He cannot make both ends meet, although he tries his best to save.
- (Elliptical) Do your best (=Although you may do your best), but you won't succeed.
- Try as you may (=Although you may try as hard as you please), you won't succeed.
- Hard as I tried (=However hard I tried), I could not hit the mark.
- Willing as I was (=Although I was willing) to help him, I had to send him away empty-handed.
- While (Although) I admit that it is so, still I cannot absolve him from all blame.
- While (Although) he was not the only person to blame, he was principally responsible for it.

Exercise 112. Make sentences implying concession or admission, making use of the above conjj. with the above sentences as models.

### 15.46. Cause and Effect

The common words expressing cause are the conjj. because, as, since, the prepp. owing to, on account of, and the participial phrase. Effect is expressed by: hence, therefore, consequently, in consequence, as a consequence, with the result that. Hence always stands at the beginning of the clause, while the position of therefore varies exactly as the word however (§ 15.42). Owing to and on account of are prepp. followed by nn. or verbal nn. (—ing), and therefore make for shorter sentences. They do not form clauses, but only prepositional phrases.

- Therefore, there was no way for me to do it.
- There was, therefore, no way for me to do it.
- There was no way, therefore, for me to do it.
- There was no way for me to do it, therefore. (rare)
- As I did not want to see him, I sent him a letter.
- As it was his fault, he had to make it up to him.
- As the train was two hours late, we strolled round the neighbourhood.
- Well, since you say so, I will go.
- Since there was nobody else to go, I went myself.
- Since it is neither white nor black, it must be grey.
- Since that is the case, we might just as well go home.
- On account of his presence, we did not express any opinion.
- Owing to (Because of) his presence, etc.
- Because he was present, etc.
- As (Since) he was present, etc.
- Consequently (In consequence, As a consequence,) he died.
- The doctor left a knife in his stomach, with the result that he died three days afterwards.
- He spoke for an hour and half with the result that the other speakers had no chance to say anything.

Of particular interest is the English construction which, like many Chinese sentences, expresses cause without any conj. whatsoever. Examples of this type are:—

- Love me, love my dog.
- Once a thief, always a thief.
- First come, first served.

### 15.47. Motive and Purpose

A slightly different relationship is expressed by words denoting purpose or motive. Generally, cause and effect are regarded as more external (an external event), while motive and purpose are internal (a mental reason for doing things). The participles thinking, seeing, hearing knowing, believing, mistaking and other similar words describing mental states are often used in this way. Other phrases often used are: in view of, with a view to (—ing), in order that, in order to, so that, for the purpose of, out of (kindness, gratefulness, etc.), by way of, to the end that.

- Believing (Thinking, Hearing) that he was in Paris, she took the next train to France.
- In her hurry, she got into a train for Lyons, mistaking it for the Paris train.
- She went there, with a view to ascertaining (in order to ascertain, for the purpose of ascertaining, so that she might ascertain) who was her husband’s new love.
- It was done purely out of jealousy.
- Out of gratefulness (for returning the handbag), she gave the coolie a present of ten dollars.
- I was doing it just out of pity, not out of love.
- In order to stop this trouble, the Government is ready to close down the whole school.
- We gave him a hundred dollars just in order to shut up his mouth.
- By way of illustrating what he meant, he produced a chart of the club’s activities.
- We should all work and labour, to the end that the new movement may become a success.

### 15.48. Comparison and Conformity

The use of conjj. for expressing comparison (more than, as . . . as) presents many grammatical peculiarities. This arises from the fact that a comparison always implies two compared members, whether nn., vbb., adjj., or whole groups of words. Thus, if I compare my age with your age and say I am three years older than you, the two members compared are: I am old and you are old, or my age and your age. Naturally, the full meaning is I am three years older than you are old, but it would be foolish to repeat the second member compared. Hence there is always a shortening of the second member: in this case, shortened to you. Also, in I know you better than he does, does in the second member takes the place of knows you.

Such omissions and peculiarities in the second compared member have already been fully studied in §§ 10.20 and 10.50. Thus we have—

- Subject omitted: He eats more than (what) is good for him. (See more than, §10.20, “1”)
- Object omitted: He eats more than (what) he can digest. (See more than, §10.20, “1”)
- Subject and vb. omitted: I love you more than (I love) her.
- Object and vb. omitted: I love you more than he (loves you).

Compare also the use of so . . that and so . . . as on p. 273 (§10.20, “2”)

The second member of comparison may be a n., a vb., an adj., an infinitive phrase, or a whole clause.

- Noun or pronoun: This is better than that.
- Verb: I would do anything rather than let him get off like that.
- An infinitive: He knows better than to go out alone on such a night.
- An adjective: This is more than fine: it is excellent.
- An adverb: I have read it more than once.
- Clause: He spends more than he is earning.
- She is as good as she is pretty.

We can also have a complex sentence in which the second member is woven into the first clause:

This is as much as I can stand.

Here we have the main clause This is much and the dependent clause as much as I can stand, serving as an adv. clause modifying much.

The usual words expressing conformity are: according as (followed by a clause), according to (followed by a n.), in conformity with, in accordance with and accordingly.

- According to Rule Six, all cinema films made in China must be censored before they are exported.
- In accordance with that rule, I am submitting this for your inspection.
- He said that all this had been done in conformity with their previous agreement.
- We treated them on the spot or sent them to a hospital according as the wounds were light or heavy.
- He is drunk or sober, according as he wins or loses (according as he fares, or according to his luck.)

### 15.49. Time and Logical Relationships

We have conjj. and advv. expressing time relationships like as soon as, meanwhile, after, introducing regular clauses. The usual advv. of this category, are, of course, when, while and as. It is found, however, that all such connecting words signifying time often develop a new meaning, which expresses another logical relationship besides time. Thus in the sentence—

Why do you try to help others, when you cannot even pay your tailor’s bills?

the relationship expressed is not one of time merely, but of a contrasting aspect. Similarly, with while and so long as:—“Why doesn’t he pay up his debt, while he is buying his wife new hats everyday?” / “So long as they don’t see each other, they get along nicely; but the moment they come together, they start quarrelling all over again.”

At the same time, in the meanwhile, in the meantime, meanwhile and while express contemporaneous action, often with contrasting effect. Pending with the same sense, is a prep. As soon as, the moment, directly, immediately and after, expressing a sequence of events, often imply an inner relationship of cause and effect also. The adv. once is particularly often used to express a causal relationship.

- Once you begin, you never know where you will end. (Cf. “—” in Chinese: “此例一開”, “一失足成千古恨.”)
- Once you taste our dinner, you will come again.
- When once he understands, he will forgive everything.
- Immediately you try to do something, people will cry you down.
- The professor began his lecture the moment he entered the room.
- Directly (= As soon as) the teacher walked out of the room, there was an uproar.
- After I had done so much for the boy, he ran away and disappeared.
- At the same time, you must remember this is not all a matter of luck. One has to work hard, too.
- Meanwhile, you go ahead with your own work.
- Pending the construction of the new building, the students will be housed in the old dormitory.
- As soon as one goes away, another comes in.

### 15.50. Interrogative Adverbs and Pronouns

It is understood that relative pronn. (who, what) and relative advv. (how, why, when, where) are partly conjj. and partly pronn. or advv., as the case may be. But, whether they are serving as relative parts or not, these interrogative words can all begin noun clauses, and may, therefore, be considered as a kind of conjj.

- How he did it I do not understand.
- This is not a question of money, but of how much we can do with the money at our disposal.
- There was no question as to who was the guilty party.
- I cannot say whether it is right or wrong.
- That was the reason why he did it. (Relative)
- We will see what we can do for you.
- Tell me when you want it ready.
- Who breaks pays.
- He refused the offer but finally had to accept what was far worse than the first offer.
- I don’t care where you live; you must come to the office at nine sharp [九點正].
- Where you live does not concern me.

### 15.60. Punctuation: Logical and Phonetic Basis

The punctuation marks or “stops” (as they are generally called in England) include the comma, the semi-colon, the colon, the full stop, the exclamation mark or point, the question mark, the quotation marks (also called “inverted commas” in British usage), the brackets and parentheses, the dash and the dotted line. The use of these marks has a close relation to sentence structure.

There are some points in the use of punctuation marks which admit of dispute. So much depends on the basis of judgment. Some grammarians believe that their use should be strictly on a logical basis, the stops being used to make clear the logical meaning, while many people hold that the stops should be on a purely phonetic basis, their use being to help the reader to know where to stop and where not to stop while reading the sentence. The latter believe that only in this way can the author’s style be correctly appreciated. All good literature, whether Chinese or English, should be read aloud to be truly appreciated, and the punctuation marks should guide the reader as to how the author intends it to be read. Illustrations of this difference will be found in the discussions on the comma.

It is clear, however, that beginners should not attempt to go upon the phonetic basis, as only after years of familiarity with language would one know exactly where a break had better, or had better not, be made in the reading. Only in the hands of expert writers may this principle be safely applied. The beginners and the average writers should go on the logical basis and attempt at the clearest expression of their meaning. The only principle involved is really Clearness. A great deal may be left to commonsense.

### 15.61. The Comma

The use or omission of the comma may often be disputed, much more so than that of the other marks. Some examples of these questionable cases will be given.

(a) In enumeration, no comma should separate the last two items where “and” exists.

- I bought a hat, a cane and a book. (Not cane,)
- Tom, Dick and Henry.
- She sings, writes poetry and plays the piano. (Cf. She sings and writes poetry and plays the piano.)

On the phonetic principle, one might write: I bought a hat, a cane, and a book. Notice that when long parallel clauses or phrases are joined by and, the comma is often quite necessary before it.

- She sings French songs, and speaks the French language fluently, and plays the piano.

(On the phonetic basis, the first comma may or may not be omitted) She sings French songs and speaks the French language fluently, and plays the piano.

It is seen that the phonetic principle is less certain, but because it is so, it allows more room to express the intention of the author. Such punctuation, and such writing, would accord more closely with the actual spoken language. On the logical basis, one should omit the first and, as follows—

She sings French songs, speaks the French language fluently and plays the piano.

But we do not always speak like that in real life, and therefore such sentences may give the impression of artificiality or stiffness.

(b) Where we have two modifiers to one noun, the second modifier or modifying phrase is often separated by two or one comma.

- She bought a very expensive, but very good-looking (,) hat.
- He was a clever, but undependable (,) assistant.

Logically, we should have two commas, but phonetically, only one is required, as no one makes a pause between the last two words.

(c) Common phrases or advv. may often be inserted without commas.

- Therefore (,) I went.
- That was (,) of course (,) a fact.
- Of course he knew. (Better than: Of course, he knew.)
- But: This was, logically speaking, incorrect.
- To be sure, he was to blame.
- The envelope, strange to say, had been cut open.

(d) Commonsense could decide the rest for securing the greatest degree of clearness.

- Any militarily weak nation would, like China, when she was invaded by Japan, resort to the boycott as the only weapon of defence. (The clause, when she was invaded by Japan, might be misinterpreted to refer to any nation; therefore, omit the comma after China and read:)
- Any militarily weak nation would, like China when she was invaded by Japan, resort to the boycott, etc.

### 15.62. The Semi-Colon

The semi-colon is usually used to separate parallel constructions or to mark a greater division of the sentence than is indicated by the comma. The characteristic of the semi-colon is that, with it, one can begin a new clause without any conjunction. E.g.—

- This was not due to carelessness; it was due to wilful neglect.

The same sentence could be written as—

- This was not due to carelessness, but (it was) due to wilful neglect.

or—

- This was not due to carelessness. It was due to wilful neglect.

One feels, however, that the two parallel statements are quite closely connected, and do not deserve to be separated by a full stop. The semi-colon, therefore, marks a division point between the full stop and the comma.

Where the logical relationship justifies the use of a semi-colon, it may be used even with a conj.—

- This was not ideal; still, it was the best one could expect under the circumstances.

Exercise 113. Correct the following by replacing commas with semi-colons or otherwise with appropriate conj.—

1. She was sent to Shanghai without her mother’s knowledge, it was against the latter’s wish.

2. Policemen were standing in the middle of the road, they stopped the tram-cars and the buses, automobiles were searched, and all passengers were subjected to a close examination.

3. On the one hand, he could not do it himself, on the other, he tried to prevent others from doing it.

4. Man proposes, God disposes.

5. Firstly, he did not want to go, secondly, he was not the best man for it, and thirdly, Dick was ready to go in his stead.

### 15.63. The Colon

The colon is usually used when one or more examples of what has just been said are about to follow. It is also used when one statement repeats another statement in a different form.

- He said: “You have won.”
- The list is as follows: one hat, two canes, three pairs of boots, etc.
- Columbus discovered a string of islands: he did not discover the American Continent.

### 15.64. The Full Stop

The full stop marks a complete sentence. There is a tendency in American journalism to make short snappy sentences, with full stops marking parts of sentences, which should not be imitated.

“There is a tendency in modern newspapers to use short snappy sentences. The shorter the better. For the snappier they are, the happier the reader will be. Which is a good thing for the busy business-man.”

The full stop is also used whenever there is an abbreviation of any sort. Examples are: Dr. (Doctor), Mr. (Mister), C.P. (Communist Party), Dec. (December), R.C.A. (Radio Corporation of America), yrs. (yours).

### 15.65. The Exclamation and Question Marks

Although the use of these marks is a matter of commonsense, a warning should be given that mistakes are often made in their employment.

- She asked me how I did it. (Not a question)
- I was meditating how wonderful it all seemed. (Not an exclamation)
- You are coming, too? (A question)
- You are not joking? (A question)
- Is that a fact! (An exclamation; but the question mark might be used; or the two “?!” might be combined.)
- How dare you? (or you!)

### 15.66. Inverted Commas

Some people prefer to use the single inverted comma, but the double inverted commas are more in general use. Quotation marks should be regarded as sacred; no word should be put within these marks which does not exist in the original quoted. If there is an omission, dotted lines should be used. If words are added, these should be put in brackets, as follows:—

“He [Mr. Henderson] . . . would not allow anybody to interfere with the policy of the Committee.

A quotation within a quotation should be marked with a single or double inverted commas, according to which one has not been used at the beginning: either “He said, ‘You have won,’ ” or ‘He said, “You have won.” ’

In quotations extending over several paragraphs, the inverted commas are used at the beginning of all the paragraphs, but only at the end of the paragraph where the quotation closes. Thus—

“ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”

### 15.67. The Dash and the Dotted Line

The dash is usually used to indicate an abrupt break of thought, with or without breaking off of the grammatical structure. There is no denying the fact that in actual life our thoughts do not run off in perfect sentences, but often change midway to something else, or are otherwise interrupted, before the original intended sentence is finished. Consequently, the modern personal style often employs the dash to indicate this break of thought. Such sentences are often actually heard in conversations, so that their use in letters or familiar essays will contribute to that informal and easy-flowing effect.

(a) Sometimes, merely a pause is meant, as in the following sentence:—

- When the mandarin fell on the floor, the first thing he would do on getting up was to readjust his tortoise-shell spectacles—leisurely, correctly.

(b) Abrupt breaks of thought are indicated in the following:—

- In order to get a divorce, you'll have to—oh, well, we won't go into that.
- I gave him full permission—in fact, I encouraged him, to examine the company's accounts.
- We had no money, no food, not sufficient clothing, being stranded in a strange city, hounded by the police from place to place—you can imagine the rest.

(c) The dash is also used after a colon, a comma, or a full stop, serving also to indicate a longer pause.

- The conditions are as follows:—
- Dear Sir,—
- For example,—

(d) The double dash is used exactly like the parentheses or brackets to indicate an inserted remark.

- After that, the three of us—i.e., my wife, my wife’s brother and myself—went into a restaurant.

This is exactly the same as—

- After that, the three of us (i.e., my wife, my wife’s brother and myself) went into a restaurant.

The dotted line indicates an unfinished thought. In the modern style, sometimes the dotted line is used to indicate bits of thought, as in reminiscences. This method of description is often more effective than perfectly connected sentences, because it is more suggestive.

- Shut up alone in the attic, I began to think of my early childhood. Effie playing in the garden . . . the nurse Jennie . . . my mother’s smiling face . . . my father’s stern eyes and prickly beard which tickled my little fingers . . . Jack my best school friend . . . the barn behind the backyard in which Jack and I used to play hide and seek . . . my story book with a green cover . . . the adventures of Captain Drake . . .

Often paragraphs end off in a dotted line, by which the meaning is conveyed that the writer has so much more to say yet, but is willing to leave it off like that (不盡欲言).

### 15.68. Parentheses and Brackets

These two terms are sometimes used indiscriminately, but a proper distinction is made between parentheses “( . . .)” and brackets “[ . . .]” Too much use of parenthetical remarks shows a loose, slipshod style and should be avoided, unless there is enough gusto in the writer to carry it through, as, for instance, in the writings of George Saintsbury. Parentheses may also contain a sign or a short phrase.

- This was the great (?) Dr. Forbes. (The insertion of the question mark implies that the writer doubts Dr. Forbes “greatness.”)
- The people were taxed to death and bled white by the "revolutionary" (?!) generals.
- Mr. Henderson continued “We cannot let the unemployment question alone, because the question will not let us alone.” (Hear! Hear!) (In this newspaper report, the “Hear! Hear!” indicates the applause of the audience at Mr. Henderson's remark.)

### 15.70. Loose and Periodic Sentences

Compare the following groups of sentences:—

(A) Loose Sentences—

- The dinner is at eight, if I am not mistaken.
- He writes fairly well, although he is a little inclined to use long words.

(B) Periodic Sentences—

- If I am not mistaken, the dinner is at eight.
- Although he is a little inclined to use long words he, writes fairly well.

In group "A," the dependent clauses stand at the end, while in group "B," they stand at the beginning. Although the contents of the sentences are the same, the stylistic effect is quite different. In the first sentence, the speaker intends to say "the dinner is at eight," where the sentence could very well stop, but "if am not mistaken" is added as an after-thought. In group "B," the same sentence is conceived as a whole from the beginning. Hence the first type (called "the loose sentence") is more informal, more natural and less pretentious, while the second type (called "the periodic sentences") is more correct and more formal. Both types have their usefulness in conveying different effects. The danger is that the Chinese student is apt to use exclusively the periodic sentence type, with the result that the sentences will lose their informal character, which is necessary to an easy, flowing style.

The loose sentence does not exist in classical Chinese. The Analects says 齊景公曰: “善哉! 信如君不君, 臣不臣, 父不父, 子不子, 雖有粟, 吾得而食諸?” It would be impossible to put the dependent clause at the end and say, “吾得而食諸, 雖有粟? or 雖有粟, 信如君不君, 臣不臣, 父不父, 子不子?” But in the modern pen-hua style, it is possible to say: “你的話好啊! 我那裏有飯喫, 雖然有粟, 假如君不君, etc.” This is an improvement in the flexibility of the language, and makes possible a truly colloquial style.
