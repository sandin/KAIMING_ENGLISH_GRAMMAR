## CHAPTER IV: PERSONS, THINGS AND THEIR GENDER

### 4.10. Classes of Things

In this chapter, we shall study the English notions regarding the classes of things that are expressed by the nouns. We have seen already (§ 2.15) that the English nouns may denote visible things (tables, chairs), invisible things (air, noise, possibility, power), or half visible and half invisible things (government, applause, happiness, middle, end). They may denote a concrete thing (table, chair), an action or event (promotion, examination, the fall of a government), or a condition (poverty, danger, prosperity) or a quality (kindness, stupidity, thinness). All these are regarded as nouns from the English grammatical point of view. To these we must add also the noun clauses, such as That he is dead (is certain), How much he took (nobody knows). They thus include more than the Chinese notion of 事物 (or “things and events”), for 事物 cannot include the abstract qualities (品性, as kindness, thinness).

These nouns have been classified in different ways by different grammarians, chiefly according to their meaning, such as “common nn.,” “proper nn.,” “material nn.” We shall soon see that such hard and fast distinctions are by no means easy to establish or strictly logical. Still, without trying to put all the nn. into any one system of classification, we can, and Englishmen do, consider the nn. as belonging to different classes expressing different notions. The following distinctions must be made clear in the student’s mind.

1. Process and Result: heating : heat
2. Abstract and Concrete: food food-stuffs / money : coins
3. Common and Proper: people : Chinese
4. Collectives: army, clergy, class
5. Mass-Words: paper, water, milk
6. Persons and Things: writer : inkstand

Each of these notional distinctions must be studied by the Chinese student, if he wants to use his nn. correctly.

### 4.20. Process and Result

In a phrase like the building of a building, or the painting of a painting, the first word building or painting denotes a process, while the second denotes the result of that process. The one implies a sense of action or motion, the other implies no such sense of motion. Compare the Chinese 他所畫的畫 and 佩帶 (=君子所佩, “what a gentleman carries,” i.e., jade, girdle, sword, etc.). There are many such distinctions in the English vocabulary, and one should make sure whether the noun denotes a process or action, or whether it denotes merely a thing, condition or quality (which may or may not be the result of the process). Compare the following:

- ACTION: wedding day, heating, allowing, immunization, differentiation, distinction, presentation, identification
- NOT ACTION (things, qualities and conditions): his marriage (result), heat, allowance (=money allowed), immunity from disease, difference, present (=thing presented), identity of person

### 4.21. Process-Words Denoting Results

It is very natural, however, that the word denoting a process is often used to denote the result of that process. From the improvement (improving) of the country, it is natural to transfer the meaning to the improvement actually made, as I noticed many improvements (things added, etc.). And from the destination (destining) of a boat’s voyage, it is natural to shift the meaning to the port to which the boat sails or is destined, as The destination is Amoy. Because the skin of roast duck or roast pig crackles in the mouth, we now call such skin crackling, and because the lining of a long gown is used for lining the inside, we call it lining. Further examples are:

- PROCESS-WORDS: washing, gathering, following, division, distinction, description, information
- RESULTS DENOTED: things to be washed (this week's washing), crowd gathered (a large gathering), group of followers (a large following), an army unit (the division commander) [師長], fame and honour (a man of distinction), type, kind (people of every description), informed news (information leaked out)

This change of meaning is very common and offers no grammatical difficulties to the student. But the student should observe the difference. When the heating of a house is bad, we should not say The heat is bad, nor should we condemn the song because the singing is atrocious.

**Exercise 34.** Find out whether action or no action is directly meant in the italicized words:

1. During Wilson’s second administration, America entered the World War.
2. You lack imagination (= imaginative power).
3. A lady’s accomplishments are: tinkling the piano and speaking a few French phrases, etc.
4. Supply is influenced by consumption (= consuming).
5. He is a victim of consumption (= tuberculosis).
6. Fertilization—fertility.  
   Communication—community.  
   Imprisonment—prison.  
   Education—knowledge.

### 4.50. Abstract and Concrete Nouns

Abstract nn. are those representing abstract ideas. Thus the Chinese conceptions of “good fortune,” “official position,” and “longevity” (福, 祿, 壽) are abstract ideas (抽象的), while “having a hundred children and a thousand grandchildren,” “being prime ministers at court and generals in the field” and “living to seventy years of age (百子千孫, 出將入相, 年逾古稀) are the corresponding concrete ideas (具體的). We may change the concrete idea and still retain the abstract notion; thus people nowadays no longer identify “having a hundred children and a thousand grandchildren” with “good fortune”; they will most likely consider having to educate seven sons and seven daughters with fifty dollars a month a curse and a form of divine punishment.

The Chinese language is highly concrete in its notions and imagery, and many Chinese students therefore fail to learn the abstract notions of English nouns. Compared with the Chinese, English abounds in abstract words. Thus, we have nien-ling (年齡, year-year) for “age,” but the abstract idea of “size” is expressed by the more concrete words ta-hsiao (大小, big-small). The ending hsing (性) for abstract nn., as in shen-shu-hsing (伸縮性, extend-shrink-character, “elasticity”), k'o-fên-hsing (可分性, may-divide-character, “divisibility”), is a modern innovation of very recent date, due to western influence. Thus many Chinese students can never learn to say, “The essay is perfect in form and content” (abstract form and content), but must always say “Its form and contents are perfect” (concrete form and contents). This is often as difficult for the Chinese students to grasp as it is well-nigh impossible for most people to distinguish between the church (concrete) and religion (abstract). They would never think it possible for Jesus to stand outside the church window, calling to the young worshippers inside, “Suffer the little children to come unto me.”

In the following, we use italics to indicate abstract ideas and bold face to indicate concrete ones.

A rosy cheek is the sign of good health.  
Eating three bowls is surely good appetite.  
This young man is full of ideas, but he lacks experience. I had once a very funny experience with him. We went together to see his uncle and get some money from him, and when we arrived, he told his uncle to go to the devil.  
China is backward in communication. She should have more roads, railways and aeroplanes.  
You have too many churches, but no religion.  
You cannot have justice, when there are too many clever lawyers.  
Our politicians have no statesmanship, and our diplomats do not understand diplomacy. They may be busy the whole day attending luncheons, dinners, and making high-sounding, silly speeches, but luncheons and dinners are not statesmanship, and fine speeches are not diplomacy.  
Maurice Maeterlinck is against war in principle (in the abstract), but he fought in the war against Germany, when the latter invaded Belgium.  
One can worship woman (in the abstract) and hate woman (in the concrete).  
You are against Wu Pei-fu, so you are the enemy of the unification of China!  
You are criticizing the present government, so you are a reactionary and an enemy of the revolution.  
You do not love me (the invisible self), you love only my money.

### 4.31. Abstract-Words with Concrete Meaning

In English, the same word has often two meanings, one concrete and the other abstract. Study the following:

- ABSTRACT: He has both youth and beauty. That's the beauty of the poem. Life is short. We love the teacher for her kindness. That man has no brains (= He is stupid). She is proud of her looks. He is keen in observation. With an air of satisfaction.
- CONCRETE: Our youths (= young men) are corrupt. Isn't she a beauty (= beautiful woman)? Many lives have been lost. Thank him for his kindnesses (acts of kindness). He has a big brain (= He has a big head). She gave him a look. He makes this observation. The fresh country air.

As abstract nn. can seldom be counted, we may often notice by the use of singular that an abstract, rather than a concrete, idea is meant. Thus, we sometimes say, “Dr. Lim has many systems, but no system,” the second word referring to an abstract systematic habit of doing things. Similarly, we have the following plurals, which show that they are here used to express concrete ideas:

- Impurities in the water: impure substances
- The pleasures of an old man: forms of pleasure
- Accused of cruelties to his wife: cruel acts
- Several possibilities exist: possible ways
- Youthful follies: foolish acts, habits
- Communication facilities: railways, trains, boats

### 4.32. A Piece of Folly, a Fit of Anger, etc.

Not all abstract nn., however, can be used to denote concrete things. Whenever in doubt, one can always use another way to express the corresponding concrete idea. We cannot talk of three furnitures, but we can always say three pieces of furniture, and we cannot speak of two infections, but we can say two cases of infection. It would seem strange to Chinese minds that we could speak of a piece of good luck (一塊福氣), but the Englishman does often use this to express a lucky event or accident. The use of piece, bit, case, form, act, etc. plus some abstract n. should be studied carefully:

- A piece of good luck, learned nonsense, folly
- Some bits of scandal, information, news
- A fit of fever, hysteria, anger
- A sudden attack of madness, fever
- Several cases of theft, malaria, typhoid, criminal neglect
- This strange form of pleasure, punishment, corruption
- His acts of kindness, cruelty, generosity
- A stroke of good fortune
- An instance (example) of his selfishness, pride, carelessness

**Exercise 35.** Use the words case, example, act, form, instance, piece, etc. plus some abstract noun in some sentences.

### 4.40. Common and Proper Nouns

The most common classification of nn. is the division into common nn. and proper nn. Examples of proper nn. are Ningpo, Mencius, Chinese, Arnold Bennett, and examples of common nn. are book, table, story, city. According to some grammars, a proper n. is defined as the name of one particular person or thing, and a common n. is defined as that of a whole class of persons or things. Any table may be called a table and any city may be called a city, whereas only one city is called Ningpo and only one man was called Mencius. This distinction is practically useful, but we should know that it is really impossible to draw a sharp line between the two. May not any negro be called a negro? Is the word negro a common or proper noun? Certainly the word Chinese can be applied to a whole class of persons, and certainly there are many Lins in China. And yet Chinese and Lin are considered proper nn. And if Chinese is considered a proper name, why is the yellow race considered a common noun? Are the moon, the sun and the earth common nouns or proper nouns? And if summer and winter (spelt with small letters) are considered common nn., because there are many summers and many winters, why are January, February and Monday, Tuesday written with capital letters at the beginning like proper nn.?

The distinction between common and proper nn. is only a relative one. The proper n. is felt to be more exact, more specific and more artificial, while the common n. is felt to be less exact, less specific and less artificial. (It should be remembered that all names are artificial.) The cigarette I smoke is called Craven “A”; there is no reason why it may not be called Creighton “X” The name is, therefore, quite artificial. The phrase China sea may be a common name, but when we decide to call the sea on the east of China the China Sea (with capital letters), we give it both a more exact name and a more exact meaning. When I call this book the Kaiming English Grammar, I am giving a comparatively exact, specific and artificial name to the book.

### 4.41. Proper Nouns and Capital Letters

Proper nn. must begin with capital letters in writing. We may write the kings of Europe or a college dean, but when we refer to the King of England or the Dean as a proper name, we begin it with a capital letter. When it is uncertain whether it is a common or proper name, usage also differs. We use capitals when we regard a name as a proper name, otherwise we use small letters. Thus we write North China, but northern China or Northern China, the far East or the Far East, western Europe or Western Europe, the orient or the Orient, Chinese classics or the Chinese Classics. Many words which were originally proper names have now become common names and are written with small letters, as china (porcelain), champagne (wine), italics (type), boycott* (movement), cynic (man). Adj. and vbb. made from proper names are generally also written with capital letters: Chinese, European, Anglicize, Romanize (also romanize).

*From Captain Boycott who was boycotted by the Irish peasants.

### 4.50. Collectives and Mass-Words

There are a class of nn. which denote a group of things or persons taken together, and which may be called collectives or collective nn. Collective nn. may be considered as singular (one group) or as plural (many individuals). Thus, we may say the Government have or has . . . / There is or are a flock of sheep / The whole staff resign or resigns. For some collectives we have no proper Chinese equivalent, as the crew of a ship (船中機師水手之總稱), the faculty of a department (一系之全體教員), the staff of a company (全體職員). We also speak of a person’s hair (meaning all the pieces of his hair) and the shot (meaning all the little lead balls discharged at one shot of the gun). Other examples are: people, nation, troop, army, clergy, family, clan, society, library, cattle, sheep, fish. For the grammatical number of these words, see § 5.22.

### 4.51. Mass-Words

The words air, copper, wood, alcohol, milk, etc. form a class by themselves. They can never be counted, for they are neither singular nor plural.

*The term “mass-word” was first proposed by Jespersen, and is a convenient distinction from the collective with which it has usually been confused. According to Jespersen, the essential difference is that collectives are both singular and plural, while mass-words are neither singular nor plural. The Jespersenian classification seems to be made with reference to number. In this book, however, I do not use this term to include abstract nouns (“immaterial mass-words”) such as health and happiness, because health and happiness have no “mass” to speak of, and because number is not the sole basis of classification here.

Among the concrete nn., these words are most like the abstract nn. (politeness, wealth) in not having number and in often being used without any article, a or the. Thus we say simply Milk is healthy food or You should take milk and not a milk, just as we say Health is happiness or That gives me happiness and not a happiness. Of course we can use the before mass-words when we mean something definite, as the air, the milk, just as we speak of the health or the happiness of the family. For the “number” of these words, see § 5.11.

### 4.60. Things and Persons

A very important distinction in English grammar is that between persons and things. One would think that the distinction between animate and inanimate things (thus putting the animals in the same class with persons) would be more logical, but, apparently, in English, we have chosen to regard man as the all-important thing in the universe and have put him in a class by himself. Things, whether animate or inanimate, may then occasionally be honoured with a “personification” and thus by a figure of speech be put on a level with human beings.

The clearest and commonest examples of this distinction between personal and impersonal objects are the pronn. he, she, him, her for persons and it, its for animals and things. Much depends also on personal interest. A child we do not know much about or are little interested in is referred to as it, but the child’s own mother seldom does so. In the same way, the master who lives in close relation with his cat or dog generally refers to the cat or dog with he or she, and not with it. Further examples are:

- For persons: who, somebody, anybody, everybody, nobody, some one, any one, every one, no one (or spelt as someone, anyone, everyone, no-one)
- For things: what (pron.), which (pron.), something, anything, everything, nothing

Some words may be used for both persons and things. E.g., the pronn. all, each, one, none and the adj. what, which.

- PERSONS: All are dead. I know all of them. Each goes his own way. The clever ones keep silent. None of them was there. What a singer! Which person do you mean?
- ANIMALS & THINGS: All is lost. I know all (=everything). Each has a tail. The bird eats all the good ones. There is none left. What nonsense! Which story is most interesting?

### 4.61. "Who," "Which" and "That"

The relative pronn. are used differently. Who (with whom) is used only for persons, which is used only for things, and that is used for both. That is, therefore, always safe to use, as one cannot make a mistake with it.

**Exercise 36.** (I) Make some sentences with:

1. all who
2. those who
3. people who
4. every one who
5. any one who
6. anything which
7. the house which
8. the book which
9. the things that (which)
10. the horse that (which)
11. the men that (who)
12. the boys that (who)

(II) Substitute who (whom) and which in the following sentences for that:

1. The man that says this is a liar.
2. Those that are afraid need not come.
3. I like fried fish that looks brown and crisp.
4. I like a girl that dresses neatly.
5. A wife may fail you, but a good cigarette (is one that) never fails.
6. Your friends may fail you, but a good wife (is one that) never fails.
7. The man that fishes is called a fisherman.
8. The line and hook that the fisherman uses is called a fishing-line.
9. A rubber is the thing that is used to rub off pencil marks. It means sometimes a person that does the rubbing.
10. A robber is one that robs, and a thief is one that steals.
11. The person that you see sitting next to Mr. Y— is my cousin.

### 4.62. "Whose" and "Of Which"

Like who and which, whose is generally used for persons and of which for things. Some writers would never allow whose to be used for other objects than persons. But this restriction is neither a help to clearness or convenience, nor historically correct.* The use of of which often requires a very troublesome, unclear and unpleasant construction, as This is a place the people, customs and geographical position of which I know nothing about. Certainly it is clearer and easier to say This is a country whose people, customs and geographical position I know nothing about. The first form is grammatically correct, but stylistically somewhat objectionable. We should say, therefore, that at least both forms may be used.

*See Modern English Usage, pp. 727-728.

**Exercise 37.** Substitute whose for of which, of whom in the following sentences:

1. The detective picked up a small, square box, the cover of which was made of fine wrought-silver, and the inside of which bore the initials “B. W. H.”
2. I was introduced to a man the name of whom was familiar to me.
3. The cripple was made the referee of the games the rules of which he was entirely ignorant of.
4. We then entered the old castle the walls of which were moss-grown and covered with ivy.
5. I received a letter the handwriting of which looked like that of my dead brother.
6. I got a book the corner of the cover of which was slightly damaged.

### 4.63. Personification

Personification, or considering an animal or a thing as a person, is of various kinds and is more common than we suspect. (a) When Laotse says “Heaven-and-earth is unkind: it (he?) treats the creation like dummy-dogs. The sage is unkind: he treats the people like dummy-dogs” (i.e., dummies made of hay used for the sacrifices) (天地不仁, 以萬物為芻狗. 聖人不仁, 以百姓為芻狗), he is there personifying heaven-and-earth, regarding it as capable of being kind or unkind, like the sage himself. The English people, too, often personify Nature, Heaven, Fate, the Furies, Fortune, Justice, Liberty, etc. Some of these examples go back to Greek tradition, and the English people often actually have the image of a goddess in their minds, when they speak of Justice or Liberty. That it should be a goddess rather than a god may seem strange to Chinese minds.*

* Compare, however, Laotse, 有名萬物之母, “The Named is the mother (and not father) of all things.”

Some older authors, too, are fond of writing Knowledge, Hope, Despair, Humanity, Courage, Patience with capital letters, but this has become out-of-fashion in modern times.

More common and more useful are the following forms of personification. (b) The use of she and her in speaking of a nation or a ship. (c) The use of personal vbb. like know, regret, remember, agree with words like the world, the people, posterity, China’s womanhood as singular subjects. (d) The use of the personal possessive form (with ’s) in connexion with non-personal objects, as the clock’s hands, the river’s mouth instead of the hands of the clock, the mouth of the river or the river mouth, and the cloud’s colour instead of the colour of the cloud. This last form should generally be avoided, except in special phrases, as “China’s sorrow” (the Yellow River), out of harm’s way, for convenience’ sake (cf. for my sake), the day’s work, a good night’s sleep, at a minute’s (or moment’s) notice. The last examples are really convenient phrases made for economy of expression, like the whose discussed above, and have little suggestion of personification.

(a) 1. As Fate would have it, he came home that evening to meet his death.
2. Fortune smiled on him, and he became the most popular novelist of the day.
(b) 3. France was asking America to cancel her war debts.
4. She (the ship) was going at 12 knots an hour.
(c) 5. The world shall long remember what the people lived through during the Great War.
6. China’s womanhood is taking the matter very much in her own hands.
(d) 7. Mr. H— was lying at death’s door.
8. Let us say, for argument’s sake, that he was cheated by others.

**Exercise 38.** Make some sentences with the following phrases:

1. For convenience’ sake.
2. Tomorrow’s work.
3. The day’s earnings.
4. Five minutes’ rest.
5. For goodness’ sake.
6. China’s foreign debts.
7. His heart’s desire.
8. The whole world knows.

(One should not use personification unless he is sure it is quite right, because personification is difficult to use and too much of it is bad taste. Instead of the mountain’s top, the car’s wheels, the river’s mouth and the road’s corner, one should use the simpler mountain top, car wheels, river mouth and road corner. And instead of China’s army, one could more easily and safely say the Chinese army. The use of she and her should especially be restricted.)

### 4.70. Sex and Gender

Gender is the grammatical distinction of sex in language. Natural sex and grammatical gender need not always be the same, and the gender of words may vary in different periods and different languages. Thus, in German, the words for maiden and woman (das Maedchen, das Weib) belong to the neuter gender, and in old English, the word girl could be used for young people of both sexes. In German today, the sun is still considered as feminine and the moon as masculine, exactly contrary to the Chinese conceptions of 太陽, 太陰. It is strange also that, while the Chinese talk so much about sex distinctions (男女有别), they have not developed a distinction between he and she in their language, while the European people who talk so much about sexual equality should insist on this he-she distinction. The Chinese character for “she” (她) dates back only to 1917. With this new character, written Chinese can express even a feminine plural (她們, feminine “they”), which cannot be expressed in English. Among the European languages, the English is most like the Chinese in sweeping away all useless gender distinctions (such as Old English for mouth masculine, tongue feminine, eye neuter, and similar nonsense in modern French and German, as German for coffee mas., milk fem., and knife neu.), the meaning of which the best grammarians of today are not able to find out.

### 4.71. Masculine, Feminine, Common and Neuter Genders

A word may be masculine (male) or feminine (female), or it may belong to the common gender (both sexes), or it may belong to neuter (neither sex). It should be noticed that things like stone, paper, pencil, water may be regarded of course as having no sex, while frogs, teachers, workers and students should be regarded as being of both sexes, although this makes no difference in English grammar. It should also be noticed that all the pron. except he (e.g., we, they, I, you) can be used without any sex distinction, and that the common gender is really the most convenient of all to use. While more and more women are coming to be senators, judges and parliament members, the best cooks and tailors are men, and not women, so that it is best to leave these words in the common gender. Whenever a distinction is desirable, we can always add some distinguishing word, as in male cook, female cook, man-servant, maidservant, boy student, girl student, boy friend, girl friend, woman governor, female judge, lady teacher, etc. The word man, representing all human beings, may be used in the common gender, as her part in man's (mankind's) history of progress and No man can tell. Further examples of common gender are: cousin, parent, relative, lover, author (although authoress may also be used for a woman author), worker, journalist, reporter, editor, doctor (doctress is chiefly in jocular use), missionary, nurse (there are male nurses), fool, neighbour, barber, hair-dresser, secretary, scientist, chairman (besides the modern chairwoman), etc. The word woman can always be added to these words (woman doctor, woman worker), while the word lady is limited to the higher classes (lady doctor, lady teacher, lady scientist). Likewise girl is used for young girls, as in girl reporter, girl worker.

### 4.72. Animals and Persons of Different Sex

It is natural that we have different words for animals and persons of different sex. In the case of animals, we do not trouble to distinguish the sex of frogs, snakes, flies, and grasshoppers by different words, while we have different words for animals which are closer to us, as bull, cow, cock, hen. When we want to include both sexes with these one-sex words, the only way is to use both, as ten brothers and sisters (7 brothers and 3 sisters, or 3 brothers and 7 sisters, or any other combination). Some commoner examples are:

- Masculine: king, father, brother, uncle, nephew, gentleman, master, actor, god, heir, emperor, negro, dog, he-goat, cock, peacock, bull, ox, drake, gander, ram, stallion, lion, tiger, hero, he-devil, bridegroom, widower, monk, bachelor, lad
- Feminine: queen, mother, sister, aunt, niece, lady, mistress, actress, goddess, heiress, empress, negress, bitch, she-goat, hen, peahen, cow, duck, goose, ewe, mare, lioness, tigress, heroine, she-devil, bride, widow, nun, (old) maid, lass
