## CHAPTER IX: MODIFICATION
第九章：修饰

### 9.10. Modification: Its Importance
### 9.10. 修饰：其重要性

We have mentioned in our discussion on sentence structure (§3.22) that a sentence, no matter how long and complicated, really consists of some of the five parts: (1) subject, (2) principal vb., (3) object, (4) modifiers (including prepositional phrases), and (5) conjunctions.
我们在关于句子结构的讨论（§3.22）中曾提到，一个句子，无论多长多复杂，实际上都由以下五部分中的某些部分组成：(1) 主语，(2) 主要动词，(3) 宾语，(4) 修饰语（包括介词短语），以及 (5) 连词。

Without the modifiers and conjunctions, we should all be speaking short, bald sentences like these—
没有修饰语和连词，我们都只能说些简短、干巴巴的句子，像这样——

Flood came.
洪水来了。

Mother died, father disappeared — son sat — door-step — wept.
母亲死了，父亲失踪了——儿子坐着——门阶上——哭泣。

Student was punished — stole books — proctor saw — dismissed — school — was beaten — father — became robber — became emperor — China.
学生被惩罚——偷书——学监看见了——开除——学校——被殴打——父亲——成了强盗——成了皇帝——中国。

Thus we should not be able to say where and when the flood came, and whether it was a big flood, a small flood, a terrible flood, or a flood that lasted only three hours—or whether it was a flood of water, or a flood of news, or a flood of tears, or a flood of words.
这样我们就无法说出洪水在何时何地发生，以及它是大洪水、小洪水、可怕的洪水，还是只持续了三小时的洪水——或者它是一场水灾，还是消息的洪流、泪水的洪流，或是言语的洪流。

Examine also the following sentence and see what an important part is played by the modifying words, phrases and clauses in italics (phrases and clauses are in brackets):—
也请审视以下句子，看看斜体的修饰词、短语和从句（短语和从句在括号内）扮演了多么重要的角色：——

(All of a sudden) and (without any warning) the terrible flood came, (a foaming, furious, thundering torrent), (that destroyed houses, streets and whole villages), (drowning men, women, children, cats, dogs and cattle) and (turning the whole region into a lake, dotted here and there with tree-tops and house-roofs with men and women on them like drowned monkeys).
（突然间）并且（毫无预警地），可怕的洪水来了，（一股泡沫翻腾、狂怒、雷鸣般的急流），（它摧毁了房屋、街道和整个村庄），（淹死了男人、女人、孩子、猫、狗和牛群）并且（将整个地区变成一片湖泊，四处点缀着树梢和屋顶，上面有男男女女像淹死的猴子一样）。

Thus we have—
因此我们有——

1. All of a sudden modifying came, or showing how the flood came.
1. All of a sudden 修饰 came，或说明洪水是如何来的。

2. Without any warning also showing how.
2. Without any warning 也说明方式。

3. The modifying flood.
3. The 修饰 flood。

4. Terrible also modifying flood.
4. Terrible 也修饰 flood。

5. A foaming, furious, thundering torrent, an appositive phrase—showing what kind of a flood it was.
5. A foaming, furious, thundering torrent，一个同位短语——说明这是什么样的洪水。

The first four words again modify torrent.
前四个词又修饰 torrent。

6. That destroyed houses, streets and whole villages, a relative clause modifying flood.
6. That destroyed houses, streets and whole villages，一个关系从句修饰 flood。

7. Drowning men, women, children, cats, dogs and cattle, a participial phrase also modifying flood.
7. Drowning men, women, children, cats, dogs and cattle，一个分词短语也修饰 flood。

8. Turning the whole region to like drowned monkeys, another participial phrase modifying flood.
8. Turning the whole region to like drowned monkeys，另一个分词短语修饰 flood。

    Into a lake further modifies turning.
    Into a lake 进一步修饰 turning。

    Dotted further modifies lake.
    Dotted 进一步修饰 lake。

    Here and there further modifies dotted.
    Here and there 进一步修饰 dotted。

    With tree-tops and house-roofs modifies dotted.
    With tree-tops and house-roofs 修饰 dotted。

    With men and women on them modifies house-roofs.
    With men and women on them 修饰 house-roofs。

    Like drowned monkeys modifies men and women.
    Like drowned monkeys 修饰 men and women。

Thus at every step we are tripping on the toes of modifying words and phrases without suspecting them.
因此，我们每走一步都会无意中碰到修饰词和短语的"脚趾"而浑然不觉。

Since modification is so common and important, a study of the various means of expressing this will greatly help the student in a fluent mastery of the English language and a better understanding of the structure of English sentences.
既然修饰如此普遍和重要，研究表达修饰的各种手段将极大地帮助学生流利地掌握英语，并更好地理解英语句子的结构。

When modification is understood, there are no other problems about sentence structure, because the subjects, principal vbb., objects and conjunctions are usually easy to find out.
当理解了修饰之后，句子结构就没有其他问题了，因为主语、主要动词、宾语和连词通常很容易找出。

We shall study in this chapter, for instance, such common and important constructions as the relative clause, the prepositional phrase, the participial phrase, the infinitive phrase and the complements of principal vbb. which are all some form of modifiers.
我们将在本章学习，例如，关系从句、介词短语、分词短语、不定式短语以及主要动词的补足语等常见且重要的结构，它们都是某种形式的修饰语。

### 9.11. Word-Classes and Word-Ranks
### 9.11. 词类和词级

In the phrase exceptionally fine music, we say that fine modifies music, and exceptionally modifies fine.
在短语 exceptionally fine music 中，我们说 fine 修饰 music，而 exceptionally 修饰 fine。

Here we feel the n. music to be the principal or chief word, and fine to be only a word used to qualify or modify it; exceptionally, again, is logically subordinate to fine.
在这里我们感觉名词 music 是主要或核心词，而 fine 只是一个用来限定或修饰它的词；exceptionally 在逻辑上又从属于 fine。

Hence, it is possible to speak of "word-rank": the modified word seems to stand on a higher rank than its modifier.
因此，可以谈论"词级"：被修饰的词似乎处于比其修饰语更高的级别。

Similarly, we can distinguish three ranks in the phrases: very (3) entertaining (2) book (1), or quite (3) well (2) written (1), or rapidly (3) rising (2) reputation (1).
类似地，我们可以在短语中区分出三个级别：very (3) entertaining (2) book (1)，或 quite (3) well (2) written (1)，或 rapidly (3) rising (2) reputation (1)。

It will help us to understand the relationships between modifiers and modified, if we use the terms "higher rank," "lower rank" (or "subordinate") and "equal rank" (or "co-ordinate").
如果我们使用"较高级别"、"较低级别"（或"从属"）和"同等级别"（或"并列"）这些术语，将有助于我们理解修饰语与被修饰语之间的关系。

Of course, we can have more than three ranks: thus in the following, each added word, except "a," modifies the modifier which stands after it—
当然，我们可以有超过三个级别：例如在下面这个例子中，除了"a"之外，每个增加的词都修饰跟在它后面的那个修饰语——

an essay
一篇散文

a written essay
一篇书面散文

a well written essay
一篇写得好的散文

a very well written essay
一篇写得非常好的散文

a not very well written essay
一篇写得不是很好的散文

a certainly not very well written essay
一篇肯定写得不是很好的散文

Word-ranks are different from word-classes or parts of speech.
词级不同于词类或词性。

Usually the first modified word is a n., the first modifier is an adj., and the third, fourth and further modifiers are advv.
通常第一个被修饰的词是名词，第一个修饰语是形容词，而第三、第四及更远的修饰语是副词。

But this is not always the case: thus in the phrase He writes well, the modified word is a vb. write, and not a n., and the first modifier is an adv. well, and not an adj.
但这并非总是如此：例如在短语 He writes well 中，被修饰的词是动词 write，而不是名词，并且第一个修饰语是副词 well，而不是形容词。

It is, therefore, necessary to keep the two classes of ideas apart: the terms, "noun," "pronoun," "adjective," "adverb," etc. refer to their word-classes, while the terms "modifier" and "modified" express their word-ranks with reference to one another.*
因此，有必要将这两类概念区分开："名词"、"代词"、"形容词"、"副词"等术语指的是它们的词类，而"修饰语"和"被修饰语"则表达了它们彼此之间的词级关系。*

Thus, in the phrase book cover, we may say the n. book is a "modifier" of the n. cover.
因此，在短语 book cover 中，我们可以说名词 book 是名词 cover 的一个"修饰语"。

This is probably clearer than to say that "the n. book is used as an adj."
这可能比说"名词 book 被用作形容词"更清晰。

We speak of "modifiers" and "modified" when referring to work-ranks, and speak of 'nouns," "adjectives," etc. when referring to word-classes or parts of speech.
当我们指词级时，我们说"修饰语"和"被修饰语"；当我们指词类或词性时，我们说"名词"、"形容词"等。

The following sections (§§9.20-9.27, pp. 207-227) may be partly or entirely omitted at the teacher’s discretion for less advanced classes.
以下章节（§§9.20-9.27，第207-227页）可由教师根据较差班级的情况部分或全部省略。

* Jespersen, who first enunciated the theory of "word-ranks," uses the term "primary" for the chief modified word, "adjunct" (or "secondary word") for the first modifier, and "subjunct" (or "tertiary word") for the second modifier.
* 首次阐述"词级"理论的 Jespersen，使用术语"primary"表示主要的被修饰词，"adjunct"（或"secondary word"）表示第一个修饰语，"subjunct"（或"tertiary word"）表示第二个修饰语。

For the sake of simplicity, which is quite a consideration in grammars for students, these words are avoided, and only the terms "modifier" and "modified" are used here.
为了简单起见（这在学生语法中是一个重要的考量），这里避免使用这些词，只使用"修饰语"和"被修饰语"这两个术语。

### 9.20. Relationship between Modified and Modifier
### 9.20. 被修饰语与修饰语之间的关系

The most common combinations of modifier and modified are either (1) of the written essay type, where we have 1 adj. + 1 n., or (2) of the book cover type, where we have two nn., the first being used to modify the second.
修饰语与被修饰语最常见的组合要么是 (1) written essay 类型，即 1 个形容词 + 1 个名词，要么是 (2) book cover 类型，即两个名词，第一个名词用来修饰第二个。

The relationship between the modified and the modifier in these two types should be studied, and often there is a question as to which type is the proper one to use.
应当研究这两种类型中被修饰语与修饰语之间的关系，并且常常存在一个问题，即哪种类型是适合使用的。

It has already been pointed out in § 2.21 that both Japan tour and Japanese tour (=tour through Japan) may be used; also both college student and collegiate student, and both South China and Southern China.
在 § 2.21 中已经指出，Japan tour 和 Japanese tour (=tour through Japan) 都可以使用；college student 和 collegiate student 也可以，South China 和 Southern China 也可以。

It has further been pointed out that combinations of the second type, like stone wall, honey-bee, motor roads, show different relationships between the modifying word and the modified.
进一步指出，第二种类型的组合，如 stone wall, honey-bee, motor roads，显示了修饰词与被修饰词之间的不同关系。

A stone wall is a wall made of stone, the honey-bee is the bee producing honey, and a motor road is a road for motor cars.
A stone wall 是由石头砌成的墙，the honey-bee 是产蜜的蜜蜂，而 a motor road 是供汽车行驶的道路。

Now it should be noticed that this second type is very common in modern English.
现在应该注意到，这第二种类型在现代英语中非常普遍。

Thus it is very common to find expressions like the geography teacher (地理教員), the China problem (中國問題), the food problem (糧食問題), the Disbandment Conference (編遣會議), maternity hospital (接生醫院) and the fire-brigade (救火隊).
因此，像 the geography teacher (地理教员), the China problem (中国问题), the food problem (粮食问题), the Disbandment Conference (编遣会议), maternity hospital (接生医院) 和 the fire-brigade (救火队) 这样的表达非常常见。

One should not say the communicative system for 交通系統, but communication system, nor unemployed situation for 失業狀況, but unemployment situation.
不应说 the communicative system 来表示"交通系统"，而应说 communication system；也不应说 unemployed situation 来表示"失业状况"，而应说 unemployment situation。

Logically speaking, the situation is not unemployed, but there is a situation of unemployment, nor is the system communicative, but really the system of communication is meant.
从逻辑上讲，situation 本身并非 unemployed，而是存在一种 unemployment 的状况；system 本身也并非 communicative，真正指的是 communication 的系统。

Below are some more examples:—
以下是一些更多的例子：——

- dining-room 飯廳
- dining-room 饭厅

It may be noticed here that a bathing costume does not refer to a costume which bathes, but one used for bathing: thus bathing is here originally a vb. turned into a n. and then used as a modifier.
这里可以注意到，a bathing costume 并不是指一件会洗澡的服装，而是用于洗澡的服装：因此 bathing 在这里原本是一个动词，变成了名词，然后被用作修饰语。

Similarly, a fishing-boat is a boat used for fishing purposes.
类似地，a fishing-boat 是用于捕鱼的船。

(But a sailing-boat may mean a boat which sails, and a printing machine may mean a machine which prints as well as a boat for sailing and a machine for printing.)
（但 a sailing-boat 可能指一艘能航行的船，而 a printing machine 可能指一台能印刷的机器，也可能指用于航行的船和用于印刷的机器。）

On the other hand, we must notice that the English language has certain phrases which may seem logically wrong, but are idiomatically recognized today.
另一方面，我们必须注意到，英语中有一些短语可能在逻辑上看起来是错误的，但在今天已被习惯用法所认可。

Thus a dead march is the correct expression for a funeral march (cf. wedding march), and a mad-doctor is the correct expression for a doctor of brain diseases (cf. madman, mad dog).
因此，a dead march 是 funeral march 的正确表达（比较 wedding march），而 a mad-doctor 是治疗脑部疾病医生的正确表达（比较 madman, mad dog）。

These phrases are created for convenience.
这些短语是为了方便而创造的。

Again Foreign Office is strictly Foreign Affairs Office or Office of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs (who is also called "Foreign Secretary," but who is really not "foreign" at all).
同样，Foreign Office 严格来说是 Foreign Affairs Office 或 Office of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs（他也被称为"Foreign Secretary"，但他实际上根本不是"foreign"）。
