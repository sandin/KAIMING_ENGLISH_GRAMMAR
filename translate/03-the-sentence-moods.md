## 句子语气

### 3.10. 什么是句子？
When we say a red rose, this is not a sentence, because we feel there is only a group of words which does not say anything.
当我们说"一朵红玫瑰"时，这不是一个句子，因为我们感觉这只是一组没有表达任何意思的词语。

What about the red rose?
那红玫瑰怎么样呢？

If we say, however, The rose is red, we feel we do say something and the meaning is complete.
然而，如果我们说"这玫瑰是红色的"，我们感觉我们确实表达了意思，并且意思是完整的。

We say, therefore, that a red rose is not a sentence, but The rose is red is a sentence.
因此，我们说"一朵红玫瑰"不是一个句子，但"这玫瑰是红色的"是一个句子。

Similarly, in Here's a red rose, The red rose smells sweet, or Her face is like a red rose, we feel each is a sentence, because each says something and the meaning is complete in itself.
类似地，在"这是一朵红玫瑰"、"这红玫瑰闻起来很香"或"她的脸像一朵红玫瑰"中，我们感觉每一个都是一个句子，因为每一个都表达了意思，并且其本身意思是完整的。

If we look carefully, we find it is always the verb (smells, is) that gives life to the whole sentence.
如果我们仔细观察，我们发现总是动词赋予整个句子生命。

On the other hand, in a red rose, the meaning is dead, because there is no verb.
另一方面，在"一朵红玫瑰"中，意思是死的，因为没有动词。

But suppose a man should tell you suddenly that your house has been burnt down, you naturally exclaim "What!"
但是，假设一个人突然告诉你你的房子被烧毁了，你自然会惊呼"什么！"

There is no verb in the exclamation, and yet don't we feel What! is a complete expression expressing a complete meaning?
这个感叹词中没有动词，然而我们难道不觉得"什么！"是一个表达完整意思的完整表达吗？

The man who first sees the fire would most probably exclaim "Fire!" and the man upstairs in the house, on hearing the cry, would also cry out "Help!"
第一个看到火的人很可能会惊呼"着火了！"，而房子里楼上的人听到喊声也会大喊"救命！"

All these are complete and independent expressions.
所有这些都是完整且独立的表达。

They express their meaning fully and clearly.
它们充分而清晰地表达了它们的意思。

We should not say Fire! or What? is not a sentence because there is no verb in it.
我们不应因为"着火了！"或"什么？"里面没有动词就说它们不是句子。

Grammar is made for language and not language for grammar.
语法是为语言服务的，而不是语言为语法服务。

Living language is not always like a school exercise.
活的语言并不总像学校的练习题。

In actual speech, we do often use expressions that contain no verbs in them, and yet the meaning is as complete as in any sentence.
在实际言语中，我们确实经常使用不含动词的表达，但其意思和任何句子一样完整。

Sometimes the verb is understood (not expressed), but this is not always true.
有时动词是隐含的，但这并非总是如此。

We may say, for the sake of grammar, that Fire! is really There is a fire shortened.
为了语法的缘故，我们可以说"着火了！"实际上是"There is a fire"的缩略形式。

But this is psychologically not true: when we cry out "Fire!", we really only want to call people's attention to the fire.
但这在心理上是不真实的：当我们大喊"着火了！"时，我们实际上只是想引起人们对火的注意。

We may mean There is a fire, but we may also mean Let everybody go and fight the fire! or we may mean Oh! now my property is all gone, and what shall I do?
我们的意思可能是"着火了"，但也可能是"让大家都去救火！"，或者我们的意思可能是"哦！现在我的财产全没了，我该怎么办？"

Our real meaning is just that word fire.
我们真正的意思就是"火"这个词。

Also, ordinarily, a red rose is not a sentence, but in answer to the question "What have you got in your hand?", "A red rose" is a good, clear and complete answer.
同样，通常"一朵红玫瑰"不是一个句子，但在回答"你手里拿着什么？"这个问题时，"一朵红玫瑰"是一个很好、清晰且完整的回答。

Again, after arranging with a friend to meet again on Saturday morning, we may say before parting:—
再者，与朋友约好周六早上再见后，我们可能在分别前说：—

All right.
好的。

Or—
或者—

All right. Saturday morning at ten.
好的。周六早上十点。

Or—
或者—

All right. Saturday morning at ten in the North Station and no mistake.
好的。周六早上十点在北站，别弄错了。

All this is perfectly good English, although in written English, we generally try to put in the proper verb.
所有这些都完全是地道的英语，尽管在书面英语中，我们通常尽量加上适当的动词。

In the same way, we have the following colloquial expressions:—
同样地，我们有以下的口语表达：—

- Your turn. (=Now it is your turn.)
- 轮到你了。

- Next! (=Next boy, stand up, etc.)
- 下一个！

- Splendid! (=That's good! Well done!)
- 好极了！

- How so? (=How can it be?)
- 怎么会这样？

- A drink? (=Do you want a drink?)
- 喝一杯？

- Nothing doing. (=I will never do it.)
- 不行。/ 没门儿。

- My mistake. (=It's my mistake: it's not your fault.)
- 我的错。

- Light, please. (=Please turn on the light.)
- 请开灯。

- Danger ahead! (=Drive slowly.)
- 前方危险！

- The idea! (=How can you, he, etc. think of such a thing?)
- 什么想法！/ 亏你想得出来！

Since there are such colloquial expressions, we must say that a sentence is simply a complete and independent expression.
既然有这样的口语表达，我们必须说，句子就是一个完整且独立的表达。

Any complete and independent expression may be called a sentence.
任何完整且独立的表达都可以称为句子。

### 3.11. 限定动词的重要性
The above cases, however, are exceptions.
然而，上述情况是例外。

Generally, a sentence must have a verb in it.
通常，一个句子必须包含一个动词。

In answer to the question "What have you got there?", the answer "A red rose" is quite complete.
在回答"你那里有什么？"这个问题时，回答"一朵红玫瑰"是相当完整的。

But usually, a red rose says nothing and cannot be called a sentence.
但通常，"一朵红玫瑰"什么也没说，不能称为句子。

Likewise, Soochow-Nanking is not a sentence, but only a group of words.
同样，"苏州-南京"不是一个句子，只是一组词语。

I go from Soochow to Nanking is a sentence, because here the finite verb (2.30) gives life to the sentence and connects the parts into a whole.
"我从苏州去南京"是一个句子，因为这里的限定动词赋予了句子生命，并将各部分连接成一个整体。

We must remember to use a verb in every sentence, because this is an important English habit, and because Chinese students often forget it.
我们必须记住在每个句子中使用动词，因为这是一个重要的英语习惯，而且中国学生常常忘记这一点。

Adjectives and participles (verbs changed into adjectives) alone cannot say anything.
单独的形容词和分词不能表达任何意思。

We can say He dies (verb), but not He dead (adjective).
我们可以说"He dies"，但不能说"He dead"。

We must say He is dead.
我们必须说"He is dead"。

Nor can we say The man playing in the garden as a sentence, but we must say The man is playing, etc.
我们也不能把"The man playing in the garden"当作一个句子，而必须说"The man is playing"等等。

Exercise 13. Supply verbs like is, feel, become, get, grow, etc. in the following sentences:—
练习13. 在下列句子中填入如 is, feel, become, get, grow 等动词：—

8. 女孩的玩具坏了，她感到非常难过。

9. She — weaker and weaker on account of illness.
9. 由于生病，她变得越来越虚弱。

### 3.20. 句子、短语和从句
#### 3.21. 主语、谓语和主要动词
If we analyze any sentence, we find we have a subject and a predicate.
如果我们分析任何一个句子，我们会发现它有一个主语和一个谓语。

The subject is what we talk about, and the predicate is what we say about the subject.
主语是我们谈论的对象，谓语是我们对主语所述的内容。

Thus in The rose is red, rose is the subject of the sentence, and is red is the predicate.
因此，在"The rose is red"中，"rose"是句子的主语，"is red"是谓语。

In Open your books, the subject you is understood, and Open your books is the predicate.
在"Open your books"中，主语"you"是隐含的，"Open your books"是谓语。

The important word in the predicate is always the principal verb.
谓语中重要的词总是主要动词。

Exercise 14. Find the predicate and principal verb in the following:—
练习14. 找出下列句子中的谓语和主要动词：—

1. The kite flies in the air. (The answer to the question "What about the kite?" give the predicate.)
1. 风筝在空中飞。

2. What makes the steam-engine run?
2. 是什么使蒸汽机运转？

3. George O'Brien knocked the fellow down.
3. 乔治·奥布莱恩把那家伙打倒了。

4. Please show him the way.
4. 请给他指路。

#### 3.22. 直接宾语和间接宾语
Some predicates contain objects of the principal verbs.
有些谓语包含主要动词的宾语。

In the first sentence above, the verb flies has no object.
在上面第一个句子中，动词"flies"没有宾语。

In the second, steam-engine is the object of the verb makes.
在第二个句子中，"steam-engine"是动词"makes"的宾语。

In the third, fellow is the object of the verb knocked.
在第三个句子中，"fellow"是动词"knocked"的宾语。

And in the fourth sentence, we have two objects, (show) him, and (show) the way.
在第四个句子中，我们有两个宾语，(show) him 和 (show) the way。

Here the meaning is the same as Please show the way to him.
这里的意思与"Please show the way to him"相同。

A person (or sometimes a thing) for whom or to whom a thing is done is called the indirect object of the verb.
一个人，或有时一个事物，为其或向其做某事，称为动词的间接宾语。

Find out the direct and indirect objects in the following:—
找出下列句子中的直接宾语和间接宾语：—

1. Give me that book, please.
1. 请给我那本书。

2. Tell your mother everything you have done.
2. 把你所做的一切都告诉你母亲。

3. Will you return me the money I lent you?
3. 你能把我借给你的钱还给我吗？

4. Miss Yang paid her friend a visit last month.
4. 杨小姐上个月拜访了她的朋友。

5. Will you do me a favour?
5. 你能帮我个忙吗？

6. His father bought him a new hat.
6. 他父亲给他买了一顶新帽子。

7. My brother made me a kite.
7. 我哥哥给我做了一个风筝。

#### 3.23. 句子结构：修饰语和连词
We have seen that the important parts in a sentence are the subject, the principal verb, and sometimes also the object.
我们已经看到，句子中的重要部分是主语、主要动词，有时还有宾语。

This is clear and easy to remember.
这很清楚，也容易记住。

All sentences are made up this way, no matter how long they are.
所有的句子都是这样构成的，无论它们有多长。

They are sometimes very long because we add words or groups of words to modify the subject, the verb or the object, and join these groups by conjunctions.
它们有时很长，因为我们添加词语或词组来修饰主语、动词或宾语，并用连词连接这些词组。

So we can classify all parts of a sentence into these five kinds: (1) subject, (2) principal verb, (3) object, (4) modifiers, and (5) conjunctions.
因此，我们可以将句子的所有部分分为这五类：(1) 主语，(2) 主要动词，(3) 宾语，(4) 修饰语，和 (5) 连词。

The sentence—"The dirty boy plucked a beautiful red rose in your garden this morning, and was caught."—may be analyzed as follows:—
句子——"那个脏兮兮的男孩今天早上在你花园里摘了一朵美丽的红玫瑰，并被抓住了。"——可以分析如下：—

- Subject—boy.
- 主语——boy。

- First verb—plucked.
- 第一个动词——plucked。

- Second verb—was caught.
- 第二个动词——was caught。

- Object of 1st verb—rose.
- 第一个动词的宾语——rose。

- Modifier of subject—the, dirty.
- 主语的修饰语——the, dirty。

- Modifier of 1st verb—in your garden, this morning.
- 第一个动词的修饰语——in your garden, this morning。

- Modifier of object—a, beautiful, red.
- 宾语的修饰语——a, beautiful, red。

- Conjunction joining the 2 verbs—and.
- 连接两个动词的连词——and。

It will be remembered that adjectives, adverbs, and prepositional phrases are always used as modifiers.
需要记住的是，形容词、副词和介词短语总是用作修饰语。

Exclamations are regarded as independent parts in the sentence, as Ah! here he is.
感叹词被视为句子中的独立成分，例如"Ah! here he is."。

The structure of the English sentence is really as simple as this, and if we remember these five kinds of sentence parts, we can understand the structure of English sentences better.
英语句子的结构确实就是这么简单，如果我们记住这五种句子成分，我们就能更好地理解英语句子的结构。

Exercise 15. Find out the subject, principal verb, object, modifiers, and conjunctions (if any), in the following sentences, and show what the modifiers modify.
练习15. 找出下列句子中的主语、主要动词、宾语、修饰语和连词，并说明修饰语修饰什么。

In The carpenter paints the door red, red modifies the object door.
在"The carpenter paints the door red"中，"red"修饰宾语"door"。

In My uncle grew angry, angry modifies the subject uncle, and in He was considered lost (They considered him lost), lost modifies the subject he.
在"My uncle grew angry"中，"angry"修饰主语"uncle"；在"He was considered lost"中，"lost"修饰主语"he"。

So words inside the predicate may modify the subject.
所以，谓语内部的词可以修饰主语。

1. Columbus discovered America by luck.
1. 哥伦布靠运气发现了美洲。

2. Magellan sailed around the world.
2. 麦哲伦环球航行。

3. Magellan made the first sailing trip around the world.
3. 麦哲伦进行了首次环球航行。

4. He got angry with me, and called me an impossible fool.
4. 他对我生气了，并称我是一个无可救药的傻瓜。

5. The sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening.
5. 太阳早晨升起，傍晚落下。

6. He left home for a long time, and was considered dead by his family.
6. 他离家很久，被家人认为已经死了。

7. Spell your words correctly, and copy them with ink, not with pencil.
7. 正确拼写你的单词，并用墨水抄写，不要用铅笔。

8. Meet me at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.
8. 明天早上十点见我。

9. I saw him crossing the street.
9. 我看见他正在过马路。

10. He was seen walking with Miss C—.
10. 有人看见他和C小姐一起散步。

11. The detective came too late, and found the thief gone and the room quite empty.
11. 侦探来得太晚了，发现小偷已经跑了，房间也空荡荡的。

#### 3.24. 短语和从句
Parts of a sentence which have a subject and predicate are called clauses, and those which don't are called phrases.
句子中具有主语和谓语的部分称为从句，没有的称为短语。

A clause is thus like an independent sentence in structure; it is in fact a sentence within a sentence.
因此，从句在结构上像一个独立的句子；它实际上是句子中的句子。

A phrase is simply a group of words without any finite verb.
短语只是一组没有限定动词的词语。

A clause is always connected with the rest of the sentence by some conjunction.
从句总是通过某个连词与句子的其余部分相连。

Study the following clauses in italics, and notice the conjunction introducing them.
学习以下斜体标出的从句，并注意引导它们的连词。

1. If you do not find him, come back and tell me.
1. 如果你找不到他，回来告诉我。

2. He was on his way back, when he met Mr. Atkinson.
2. 他在回来的路上，遇到了阿特金森先生。

3. I shall always remember how he treated me, as long as I live.
3. 只要我活着，我就会永远记得他是如何对待我的。

4. That he was killed is certain.
4. 他被杀是确定的。

5. Why he went away nobody knows.
5. 他为什么离开，没人知道。

Find out the subject and principal verb in each of the above clauses.
找出上述每个从句中的主语和主要动词。

A phrase may be a prepositional phrase (beginning with a preposition, as in the garden, by his family), an infinitive phrase ("to" followed by a verb, as to see it, to be seen), a participial phrase (beginning with a participle, as crossing the street, singing a song), or any combination of words that does not contain a finite verb.
短语可以是介词短语，不定式短语，分词短语，或者任何不含限定动词的词语组合。

For instance
