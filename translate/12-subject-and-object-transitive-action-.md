## XII. 主语与宾语（及物动作）

### 12.10. 主语与施动者

We shall now see the relation between the subject, the object, and the vb of action.
我们现在来探讨主语、宾语与动作动词之间的关系。

It should be realized that the “subject” of a vb and the “doer” of an action are not always the same thing.
应当认识到，动词的“主语”与动作的“施动者”并非总是同一事物。

It is true that, ordinarily, the subject is the doer of an action, as in He teaches English / She plays piano.
诚然，通常情况下主语是动作的施动者，例如“他教英语”/“她弹钢琴”。

But in the passive voice, we immediately see that this is not true, as in I am told, and the officer has been impeached, where the subjects I and officer do nothing whatsoever, but are only affected by the actions mentioned.
但在被动语态中，我们立刻发现情况并非如此，例如“我被告知”和“那位官员遭到弹劾”，其中的主语“我”和“官员”并未做任何事，而只是受到所述动作的影响。

Also in This is a book, no action is implied at all: the subject this does nothing.
同样，在“这是一本书”中，完全不涉及动作：主语“这”没有做任何事。

A subject is usually defined as the person or thing we talk about, while all that is said about the subject is called the predicate, (vb. and object included).
主语通常被定义为我们谈论的人或事物，而关于主语所说的一切则称为谓语（包括动词和宾语）。

This general definition will do for practical purposes, although in He teaches English, we really talk about the teaching (vb.) and what is taught (object), as well as about the person who does the teaching (subject).
这个通用定义在实际应用中尚可，尽管在“他教英语”中，我们实际上谈论的是教学（动词）和被教的内容（宾语），以及进行教学的人（主语）。

It should be realized, therefore, that the notion “subject” is purely grammatical.
因此应当认识到，“主语”这个概念纯粹是语法上的。

It indicates merely a certain grammatical function in a sentence.
它仅指示句子中的某种语法功能。

English vbb. always require a subject, whereas Chinese vbb. don’t.
英语动词总是需要主语，而汉语动词则不需要。

In English, we say It rains, although we do not know what rains, perhaps “heaven,” perhaps (still better) the rain itself.
在英语中，我们说“It rains”，尽管我们不知道是什么在下雨，也许是“天”，也许（更恰当的说法是）雨本身。

In Chinese, we are not compelled to find or express the subject of the vb. when it does not exist, as, for instance, in 下雨了 (compare 雨下了), 不行了, 不對了.
在汉语中，当动词的主语不存在时，我们并不被迫去寻找或表达它，例如“下雨了”（比较“雨下了”）、“不行了”、“不对了”。

We also say 有一次, 有一天, where we do not really know what is the subject of the vb. 有
我们也说“有一次”、“有一天”，在这些表达中我们并不真正知道动词“有”的主语是什么。

### 12.11. 宾语与受影响方

The object is always the party affected by the action.
宾语总是受动作影响的一方。

In He told me, of course the object me indicates the person affected by the act of telling.
在“他告诉我”中，宾语“我”当然指示受告知行为影响的人。

But, conversely, the party affected is not always the object: it may be the subject of a passive vb., as I in I am told.
但是，反过来，受影响方并非总是宾语：它可能是被动动词的主语，如“I am told”中的“I”。

Notice also that, with the vb. to be, where no action is indicated, there is no party affected, and consequently no “object,” but only a “complement”: as in He is her husband, where her husband merely completes the meaning of is (see § 9.90).
还需注意，对于动词“to be”，由于不表示动作，就没有受影响方，因此没有“宾语”，只有“补语”：如“He is her husband”，其中“her husband”仅仅补全了“is”的意义（见 § 9.90）。

An object is affected by an action usually, but not always, as the receiver of the action.
宾语通常作为动作的接受者而受动作影响，但并非总是如此。

In He opens the door, of course the object door directly receives the action, as it were.
在“他开门”中，宾语“门”当然可以说是直接接受了动作。

But there are two special kinds of objects, which are affected in a different way.
但是有两种特殊的宾语，它们以不同的方式受到影响。

The first is the object of result, as in dig a grave, where the grave is the result of the digging.
第一种是结果宾语，如“挖一个坟墓”，其中“坟墓”是挖掘的结果。

There was no grave until some one dug it, and consequently there was really nothing there to be affected by the action.
在有人挖掘之前并不存在坟墓，因此实际上那里没有任何东西可以受到该动作的影响。

Examples of this kind of object are We make cakes / They form a circle / He writes a letter / He paints flowers.
这类宾语的例子有：“我们做蛋糕”/“他们围成一个圈”/“他写一封信”/“他画花”。

The other kind, which may be called the repetitive object, really repeats the vb. only, as in She dreamed a dream / He smiled a smile / They fight a good fight.
另一种可以称为重复宾语，它实际上仅仅重复了动词，如“她做了一个梦”/“他笑了笑”/“他们打了一场好仗”。

This is very similar, logically, to the conception that Rain rains or Snow snows (although we merely say It snows, It rains in English).
从逻辑上讲，这与“雨下雨”或“雪下雪”的概念非常相似（尽管在英语中我们只说“It snows”、“It rains”）。

### 12.12. 语法主语与宾语

It has already been pointed out that the terms “subject” and “object” merely indicate grammatical functions.
已经指出，“主语”和“宾语”这些术语仅仅指示语法功能。

Further illustrations will make this clear.
进一步的例证将使这一点更加清晰。

In “The statue stands (in the yard),” “The mountain stretches (to the north),” “The street turns (to the right),” and “The bridge spans (the river),” “The food agrees (with my stomach),” none of these things, statue, mountain, street, bridge or food, really does anything at all.
在“雕像矗立（在院子里）”、“山脉延伸（向北）”、“街道转弯（向右）”和“桥梁横跨（河流）”、“食物合（我的胃）”中，雕像、山脉、街道、桥梁或食物这些事物实际上根本没有做任何事。

With abstract nn. this is still clearer: “The question arises,” “School opens,” “The semester begins,” “The problem includes (many factors),” “A lawsuit drags on, or hangs on (for years).”
对于抽象名词，这一点更加清晰：“问题出现”、“学校开学”、“学期开始”、“问题包含（许多因素）”、“诉讼拖延，或悬而未决（数年）”。

Here the subjects are really incapable of any action.
这里的主语实际上 incapable of any action。

In the same way, in We hold a meeting, it is hard to see how we can do anything to the object “meeting,” or in Give him a warning or Teach him a lesson, how the warning or the lesson is affected by the man who wants to give or teach it.
同样，在“我们开会”中，很难看出我们能对宾语“会议”做什么；或者在“给他一个警告”或“给他一个教训”中，警告或教训如何受到想要给予或教导它的人的影响。

In take a bath, take a look, take a seat, do we really do anything to “the bath,” “the look” or “the seat”?
在“洗澡”、“看一看”、“坐下”中，我们真的对“洗澡”、“看”或“座位”做了什么吗？

And in He cut a funny figure, just how was that imaginary thing “figure” affected by the person who “cut” it?
而在“他出洋相”中，那个想象中的事物“洋相”究竟是如何被“出”它的人所影响的？

All these show that the relationships indicated by the “subjects” and “objects” are merely grammatical.
所有这些都表明，“主语”和“宾语”所指示的关系仅仅是语法上的。

It is advisable therefore to distinguish between the “doer” of an action and the “subject” of a vb. on the one hand, and on the other, between the “party affected” by the action and the “object” of the vb.
因此，建议一方面区分动作的“施动者”和动词的“主语”，另一方面区分受动作影响的“受影响方”和动词的“宾语”。

The terms “doer” and “party affected” are notional, while the terms “subject” and “object” are grammatical.
“施动者”和“受影响方”是概念性术语，而“主语”和“宾语”是语法性术语。

(NOTE.—It is considered advisable to avoid the terms “logical subject” and “psychological subject” which mean so many different things with different grammarians.
（注：建议避免使用“逻辑主语”和“心理主语”这些术语，因为它们在不同的语法学家那里含义各异。

Sometimes these are used to denote the psychologically most important or most prominent word (He is wrong / I am right), sometimes to denote what comes first (They saw him / She married him), sometimes what is already known, with what is less well known as the predicate (He was her brother), sometimes the doer (He was loved by his father), sometimes the word stressed (You can’t deceive me), etc.
有时它们用来表示心理上最重要或最突出的词（他错了/我对了），有时表示首先出现的成分（他们看见了他/她嫁给了他），有时表示已知信息，而谓语表示不太为人所知的信息（他是她的兄弟），有时表示施动者（他被他父亲所爱），有时表示被强调的词（你骗不了我）等等。

Used in these senses, a “psychological subject” is merely like a focussed point in a given picture, and it will never be possible to limit that focus to just any one word.
在这些意义上使用时，“心理主语”仅仅像给定图片中的一个焦点，而且永远不可能将那个焦点限定在任何一个词上。

Very often the whole sentence forms a unified concept with no central focus or with an even focus, where we should have to admit that the whole sentence is the subject, which would be absurd, grammatically speaking.
很多时候，整个句子形成一个统一的概念，没有中心焦点或焦点均匀，这时我们就不得不承认整个句子是主语，这在语法上是荒谬的。

Such problems belong more properly in the province of logic).
这类问题更恰当地属于逻辑学的范畴。）

### 12.20. 主语的种类

The kinds of subject in the English language are represented by the following examples:—
英语中主语的种类由以下例子代表：—

- (Noun) The garden is in bloom.
- （名词）花园里鲜花盛开。

- (Verbal N.) Fishing is a pleasant pastime.
- （动名词）钓鱼是一种愉快的消遣。

- (Pronoun) He was a fool. It is winter.
- （代词）他是个傻瓜。现在是冬天。

- (Infinitive) To talk is easy; to act, difficult.
- （不定式）说容易；做，难。

- (Noun Clause) How he did it I can’t understand. Whether he did it or not is none of my business. That this is wrong is admitted. Who breaks pays. Who steals my purse steals trash.
- （名词性从句）他是怎么做的我无法理解。他做没做不关我的事。这是错的已被承认。谁打破谁赔偿。谁偷我的钱包谁就偷垃圾。

These are the standard types.
这些是标准类型。

Bearing the distinction between grammatical and notional categories in mind, we may discuss a few cases where notionally some subjects are implied which are not so expressed in English.
牢记语法范畴和概念范畴之间的区别，我们可以讨论几种情况，其中在概念上隐含了一些在英语中没有如此表达的主语。

We have the following forms expressing about the same thing:—
我们有以下几种表达大致相同意思的形式：—

- (A) Who believes such a story is a fool.
- （A）相信这种故事的人是傻瓜。

- (B) He who believes this story is a fool.
- （B）相信这个故事的人是傻瓜。

- (C) He is a fool to believe this story.
- （C）他相信这个故事是傻瓜。

- (D) He is a fool if he believes this story.
- （D）如果他相信这个故事，他就是傻瓜。

Grammatically speaking, in “A,” who believes such a story is the subject; in “B,” he is the subject, with the relative clause who believes this story modifying it; in “C,” he is the subject with the infinitive phrase to believe this story modifying the vb. is; and in “D,” he is again the subject, with the subjunctive clause if he believes this story modifying the vb. is.
从语法上讲，在“A”中，“who believes such a story”是主语；在“B”中，“he”是主语，关系从句“who believes this story”修饰它；在“C”中，“he”是主语，不定式短语“to believe this story”修饰动词“is”；在“D”中，“he”再次是主语，虚拟条件从句“if he believes this story”修饰动词“is”。

This is all very correct, because if he did not believe this story, he would not be a fool.
这都是非常正确的，因为如果他不相信这个故事，他就不会是傻瓜。

The infinitive phrase in “C” and the if-clause in “D” therefore properly modify the vb. is, and not the subject he.
因此，“C”中的不定式短语和“D”中的if从句恰当地修饰动词“is”，而不是主语“he”。

But, notionally, don’t they come to the same thing as he who believes this story in “B” where the who-clause modifies the subject he and not the vb. is?
但是，从概念上讲，它们难道不是与“B”中的“he who believes this story”一回事吗？在“B”中，who从句修饰主语“he”而不是动词“is”。

And, notionally, is not he who believes this story in “B” as much the subject of is as who believes such a story in “A”?
而且，从概念上讲，“B”中的“he who believes this story”难道不也和“A”中的“who believes such a story”一样是“is”的主语吗？

Do not—
难道不——

Believing this story, he is a fool
相信这个故事，他是傻瓜

and
和

If he believes this story, he is a fool
如果他相信这个故事，他就是傻瓜

really say the same thing?
真的说的是同一件事吗？

So it is correct to say that, in He is a fool if he believes this story, we really mean he-who-believes-this-story is a fool.
因此，可以说，在“He is a fool if he believes this story”中，我们真正的意思是“he-who-believes-this-story is a fool”。

Therefore, notionally speaking, he-who-believes-this-story is the subject of the vb. is.
因此，从概念上讲，“he-who-believes-this-story”是动词“is”的主语。

### 12.21. “It”作主语

(a) In the following sentences, the words in italics indicate the real, though not the grammatical, subject of the vb.—
(a) 在以下句子中，斜体词指示动词的真实主语（尽管不是语法主语）——

It is wrong to tell a lie.
说谎是错误的。

It is true that I dislike him.
我不喜欢他是真的。

These mean the same thing as—
这些与以下意思相同：

To tell a lie is wrong.
说谎是错误的。

That I dislike him is true.
我不喜欢他是真的。

The form with it as the grammatical subject is used because it is much more convenient to dispose of the short predicate first and then state the long subject afterwards.
使用“it”作为语法主语的形式是因为先处理简短的谓语，然后再陈述长主语要方便得多。

It seems as if we were to say It is wrong and then, in answer to the question “What is it?” say: to tell a lie.
这似乎像是我们先说“It is wrong”，然后回答“What is it?”这个问题时说：“to tell a lie”。

To tell a lie is, therefore, said to be “in apposition” to the subject it.
因此，“To tell a lie”被称为与主语“it”是“同位语”关系。

In It is true that I dislike him, the subject it may be considered as the “antecedent” of the relative clause that I dislike him.
在“It is true that I dislike him”中，主语“it”可以被视为关系从句“that I dislike him”的“先行词”。

(See § 7.45 for further examples.)
（更多例子见 § 7.45。）

(b) It is also often used without any clear meaning, but merely to satisfy the English grammatical requirement for a subject, as in It rains / It was winter / It is never too late to mend.
(b) “It”也常常在没有任何明确意义的情况下使用，仅仅是为了满足英语语法对主语的要求，例如“It rains”/“It was winter”/“It is never too late to mend”。

We really do not know, and do not care to know, what is never too late to mend, or what was winter.
我们真的不知道，也不想知道，什么“亡羊补牢，为时未晚”，或者什么“是冬天”。

### 12.22. “There is”

The peculiar construction there is corresponds to the Chinese yu (有): There is a boy (=有一小孩).
特殊的结构“there is”对应于汉语的“有”：“There is a boy”（=有一小孩）。

In such sentences, we are forced to assume that the n. following there is is the subject: thus in There is a boy, boy is the subject, and is the vb.
在这类句子中，我们被迫假定跟在“there is”后面的名词是主语：因此在“There is a boy”中，“boy”是主语，“is”是动词。

Really it does not mean quite the same thing as A boy is there.
实际上，它的意思与“A boy is there”不完全相同。

Phonetically, there in there is, there are is always pronounced without stress or accent: [ðə] ([ðə'rɪz], and [ðə'rɑː] or [ðərə]).
在语音上，“there is”和“there are”中的“there”总是无重音或非重读
