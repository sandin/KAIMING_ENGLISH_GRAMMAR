### The Science of Expression
### 表达的科学

The Kaiming English Grammar represents the application of a new philosophy of grammar to the teaching of English grammar to Chinese students.
《开明英语语法》代表了一种新的语法哲学在中国学生英语语法教学中的应用。

It regards all grammatical forms and constructions as merely means of expressing notions, and grammar itself as a science of expression.
它将所有语法形式和结构仅仅视为表达概念的手段，而语法本身则是一门表达的科学。

Instead of starting from the outward form to the inner meaning, it starts from the inner meaning to the outward form, from the notions to the expression of these notions.
它不是从外在形式到内在含义，而是从内在含义到外在形式，从概念到这些概念的表达。

Consequently, instead of concerning itself with the definitions and analysis of word-forms and formal changes, it goes deeper into the psychology of the speaker, and asks what are the notions back of the speaker's mind, which he is trying to express, and by what grammatical means he expresses them.
因此，它不再专注于词形和形式变化的定义与分析，而是更深入地探究说话者的心理，询问说话者试图表达的、潜藏在其思维背后的概念是什么，以及他使用何种语法手段来表达它们。

Grammar therefore, concerns itself with (1) the notions, and (2) the expression of these notions.
因此，语法关注的是（1）概念，以及（2）这些概念的表达。

To these questions all grammatical changes and constructions are related and made subordinate.
所有的语法变化和结构都与这些问题相关并隶属于它们。

This emancipated view of grammar is made possible through the ideas of Benedetto Croce, and, more specifically, through the epoch-making works of Otto Jespersen (Philosophy of Grammar, 1924) and Ferdinand Brunot (La Pensée et la Langue, 1922).
这种解放性的语法观得益于贝内德托·克罗齐的思想，更具体地说，得益于奥托·叶斯柏森（《语法哲学》，1924年）和费迪南德·布鲁诺（《思想与语言》，1922年）的开创性著作。

### Chinese and English Compared
### 中英文比较

In a way, the Kaiming English Grammar contains within its covers the adumbrations of a new comparative grammar of the English and the Chinese language.
在某种程度上，《开明英语语法》书中包含了英汉新比较语法的雏形。

This, again, reduces itself to a comparison of the English and Chinese notional categories and the different means employed to express these notions.
这又归结为对英汉概念范畴以及表达这些概念所采用的不同手段的比较。

The points mentioned, however, are strictly of a practical, rather than theoretical, nature, and are made in order to help the Chinese students overcome certain psychological difficulties.
然而，所提及的各点严格来说是实用性质的，而非理论性的，其目的在于帮助中国学生克服某些心理上的困难。

Many common grammatical mistakes can be corrected very easily by this psychological method, and by no other way.
许多常见的语法错误可以通过这种心理方法轻易纠正，而别无他法。

Where there are national differences in the notions themselves, the obvious way is of course to train the Chinese students in the new way of thinking.
在概念本身存在民族差异的地方，显而易见的方法当然是训练中国学生掌握新的思维方式。

And where common notions exist in both languages, as in the majority of grammatical categories, the most interesting thing would be to show how differently the two languages express these notions.
而在两种语言存在共同概念的地方（如大多数语法范畴），最有趣的事情莫过于展示这两种语言如何以不同的方式表达这些概念。

English grammar, presented in this way, therefore, teaches the English ways of thinking and expression.
因此，以这种方式呈现的英语语法，教授的是英语的思维和表达方式。

The student is constantly made to ask himself this question: If I have a given idea, how shall I express it in English?
学生被不断地引导去问自己这个问题：如果我有一个特定的想法，我该如何用英语表达它？

### Why Mistakes Are Made
### 错误产生的原因

The distinction between notions and their expressions is merely a logical, not a real, one.
概念与其表达之间的区别仅仅是逻辑上的，而非实际存在的。

There is no thinking which is not a way of expression, and no expression which is not a way of thinking.
不存在不是表达方式的思维，也不存在不是思维方式的表达。

We think while we talk, and many ladies talk in order to find out what they think.
我们边说话边思考，而许多女士通过说话来弄清自己的想法。

The ways of thinking and expression are really inseparably bound up with each other.
思维方式和表达方式实际上是密不可分地联系在一起的。

Consequently, there can be no grammar claiming to teach the expressions which does not at the same time teach the ways of thinking.
因此，没有哪一种语法能在声称教授表达的同时，不教授思维方式。

When grammatical mistakes are made, it is because the ways of thinking and habits of expression are wrong.
当出现语法错误时，那是因为思维方式和表达习惯是错误的。

Mistakes are of two kinds: those due to foreign ways of thinking, found naturally among the foreign students of a language, and those due to other psychological causes, like conflict of ideas, change of mind, human forgetfulness, influence of near-by words, etc.
错误有两种：一种是由于外语思维方式造成的，这在语言学习者中自然存在；另一种是由于其他心理原因造成的，如思想冲突、改变主意、人类健忘、邻近词语的影响等。

Mere knowledge of rules does not prevent either the foreign student or the native speaker from making mistakes.
仅仅了解规则并不能防止外语学习者或本族语者犯错。

The only sensible way of teaching grammar and making it effective is, therefore, to regard it as the science of expression and build up certain correct, idiomatic habits of thinking and expression through repeated and systematic drills.
因此，教授语法并使其有效的唯一明智方法，是将其视为表达的科学，并通过重复和系统的操练，建立起某些正确的、地道的思维和表达习惯。

### Grammar or No Grammar?
### 要语法，还是不要语法？

The failure of the teaching of grammatical rules to ensure correctness of expression has caused many people to throw grammar contemptuously aside, and advocate progressive and assimilative reading to take the place of conning over grammatical paradigms.
语法规则教学未能确保表达的正确性，导致许多人轻蔑地将语法抛在一边，并提倡通过渐进式和吸收性的阅读来取代死记硬背语法范式。

So far as this method emphasizes the building of unconscious habits rather than rigmarole grammar, it is quite sound.
就这种方法强调建立无意识的习惯而非冗长复杂的语法而言，它是相当合理的。

The advocate of progressive reading, however, is labouring under a fear-complex, regarding grammar as the student's bugaboo.
然而，渐进式阅读的倡导者却背负着一种恐惧情结，将语法视为学生的噩梦。

There is no reason why this should be so, when grammar is regarded, as it should be regarded, as merely a series of systematic drills on classes of expressions which every speaker must employ.
当语法被恰如其分地视为仅仅是对每个说话者都必须使用的各类表达式进行的一系列系统操练时，就没有理由会这样。

No sane advocate of the reading-without-grammar method would deny that the value of such reading lies really in picking up turns of expression in living contexts, and that by arranging these turns of expression in notional classes and providing systematic drills, the picking up of such expressions can be made much easier and more pleasant.
任何理智的"阅读不学语法"方法的倡导者都不会否认，这种阅读的价值实际上在于在生动的语境中习得表达方式，并且通过将这些表达方式按概念类别排列并提供系统操练，习得这些表达方式会变得更容易、更愉快。

There is no gainsaying the fact that coming across a lone expression here and there and finding its parallels after long intervals is less effective and less convincing than having that lone example immediately reinforced by a dozen other examples of the same class and construction.
无可否认的是，零星地遇到一个孤立的表达式，并间隔很长时间才找到其同类，其效果和说服力远不如让那个孤立的例子立即得到同一类别和结构的十几个其他例子的强化。

Put in this way, there can be no argument against grammar.
这样说来，就没有理由反对语法了。

### The Bugaboo of Rules
### 规则的噩梦

I should have mentioned a third cause of grammatical mistakes, that due to efforts at “correctness” and fear of breaking grammatical rules.
我本应提到语法错误的第三个原因，即由于追求"正确性"和害怕违反语法规则所致。

This fear can be carried so far as to override all natural idioms.
这种恐惧可能发展到压倒所有自然习语的地步。

The poor boy who begins to say “Whom are you?” after having learnt grammar at a night-school, or the Ziegfeld Follies girl who says “between you and I” with some sort of conscious pride is really only labouring under a confusion of mind engendered by the subtle rules of grammar.
那个在夜校学了语法后开始说"Whom are you?"的可怜男孩，或者那个带着某种自觉的骄傲说"between you and I"的齐格菲富丽秀女孩，实际上只是承受着语法微妙规则所引发的思维混乱。

Even among foreign students, this type of grammar with so many “don’ts” and “shall-nots” is more likely to make the school-boy feel he is treading treacherous ground in a room full of traps and secret doors rather than using plain English to express his ideas.
即使在外语学习者中，这种充斥着诸多"禁止"和"不应"的语法，也更可能让学童感觉像是在布满陷阱和暗门的房间里踏足险境，而不是在用简单的英语表达自己的想法。

Such abominations as “if war will break out next week” and “I had been sick before yesterday noon” are only the products of this type of grammar teaching.
诸如"if war will break out next week"和"I had been sick before yesterday noon"这类可憎的表达，仅仅是这种语法教学的产物。

Psychologically speaking, correctness is the enemy of natural expressiveness, and the teaching of grammar, instead of increasing the student’s power of expression, can actually become the nightmare which makes all natural expressiveness impossible.
从心理学上讲，正确性是自然表达力的敌人，而语法教学非但不能增强学生的表达能力，反而可能成为使所有自然表达成为不可能的噩梦。

### All Grammatical Rules Leak
### 所有语法规则皆有漏洞

But there is a deeper logical reason for the futility of rules.
但规则之所以无效，有一个更深层次的逻辑原因。

It is Edward Sapir, the gifted philologist, who says that all grammatical rules leak.
正是那位天才的语言学家爱德华·萨丕尔说过，所有语法规则皆有漏洞。

There is nothing harder to bear than the college graduate who has learnt or taught a little grammar, and who, always armed with rules of tense sequence or syntax in much the same sense as a professional lawyer is armed with the articles of a criminal code, jumps upon your perfectly idiomatic expressions, possibly correcting your “let alone . . .” into a “letting alone . . .”, insisting that it must be a participial phrase, or changing your “the boat sails next Monday” into “the boat will sail, etc.”
没有什么比遇到一个学过或教过一点语法的大学毕业生更让人难以忍受的了，他们总是拿着时态呼应或句法的规则，其架势宛如职业律师手持刑法条款，对你完全地道的表达吹毛求疵，可能把你的"let alone……"改成"letting alone……"，坚持认为那必须是一个分词短语，或者把你的"the boat sails next Monday"改成"the boat will sail, etc."。

If the incidental remarks contained in this book can help to shake the teacher’s faith in rules and reveal the more intimate phases of an Englishman’s speech, it will have served some purpose.
如果本书中包含的零星评论能有助于动摇教师对规则的信念，并揭示英国人言语中更为内在的方面，那么本书就算起到了一些作用。

### A Grammar without Rules
### 没有规则的语法

It is time that we replace the categorical rules and equally categorical exceptions with more observation of the living facts of the language.
是时候用对语言鲜活事实的更多观察，来取代那些武断的规则和同样武断的例外了。

The power of expression can be trained only by learning the expressive, ever-changing idioms, and not by putting on the grammatical strait-jacket.
表达能力只有通过学习富有表现力、不断变化的习语来培养，而不是通过套上语法的紧身衣。

Grammar, as the science of expression, should be more subtle and less rigid; it should address itself more to the speaker's intentions and less to the rules and definitions.
语法，作为表达的科学，应该更加精妙而不那么僵化；它应该更多地关注说话者的意图，而不是规则和定义。

It should be more concrete and wallow less in the terms of Latin origin.
它应该更加具体，少沉溺于拉丁词源的术语。

It should also be more positive and less like a criminal code.
它也应该更加积极，少像一部刑法典。

It has been the effort of the present author to replace such categorical rules by observations on the present usage.
本书作者一直致力于用对当前用法的观察来取代这类武断的规则。

The English language is a living thing, and this is the only way to deal adequately with it.
英语是一门活的语言，这是充分对待它的唯一方式。

It is hoped that, through this means, the student will form a more intimate acquaintance with modern English usage than is otherwise possible.
希望通过这种方式，学生能比用其他方式更深入地熟悉现代英语的用法。

It remains only to acknowledge my great debt to all previous writers on the subject who take the same views of grammar as I do.
最后，仅向所有在此课题上与我持相同语法观的前辈作者们表示深深的感激。

My debt to Prof. Jespersen and his Modern English Grammar and Philosophy of Grammar will be evident to all users of the said books.
我对叶斯柏森教授及其《现代英语语法》和《语法哲学》的 indebtedness，所有使用过上述书籍的读者都会明了。

I have incorporated his views and examples in this book on many points, although, naturally, I have not dared to go quite as far in the matter of new terminology in a book that is intended for general school use.
我在许多方面将他的观点和例子融入了本书，尽管自然，在一本旨在供普通学校使用的书中，我不敢在新术语方面走得那么远。

Thus, I have managed to keep all the eight parts of speech intact, for instance.
例如，我设法保留了所有的八个词类，未作改动。

Above all, I have derived courage from him, as well as from Prof. Ferdinand Brunot and M. Henri Frei, for this somewhat heretical venture.
最重要的是，我从他那里，也从费迪南德·布鲁诺教授和亨利·弗雷先生那里，为这项有些离经叛道的尝试汲取了勇气。

Thanks are also due to the authors of the Concise Oxford Dictionary and Modern English Usage for enlightening articles and examples.
同样感谢《简明牛津词典》和《现代英语用法》的作者们提供了富有启发性的文章和例子。
