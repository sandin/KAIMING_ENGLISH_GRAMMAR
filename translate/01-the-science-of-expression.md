## CHAPTER I. THE SCIENCE OF EXPRESSION
## 第一章 表达的科学

(This chapter may be omitted for less advanced classes; the contents, however, must be fully explained to the students by the teacher, so that they will get a new way of looking at grammar.)
(本章对于程度较低的班级可以省略；然而，教师必须向学生充分解释其内容，以便他们获得看待语法的新视角。)

### 1.10. Something to Say and Way of Saying It
### 1.10. 言之有物与表达方式

You have already studied English for three or four years.
你已经学习英语三四年了。

You know already something about the parts of speech and the forms and relations of words, like singular and plural, subject and predicate, etc.
你已经对词类以及词的形式和关系（如单复数、主语和谓语等）有所了解。

Now we want to make a more general study of the different forms and relations, and this we call the study of English grammar.
现在，我们要对这些不同的形式和关系进行更概括性的研究，我们称之为英语语法的学习。

Probably you have heard that grammar is difficult and dry.
你可能听说过语法既难学又枯燥。

This is not true.
事实并非如此。

It is difficult and dry if you study it in the wrong way, if you try only to remember the rules and definitions.
如果你学习方法不当，如果只是试图记住规则和定义，那么它就会变得难学且枯燥。

It should not be difficult or uninteresting, if you study the many living idioms and forms of expressions, and find out how an Englishman would express an idea which you have in mind.
如果你学习许多鲜活的习语和表达形式，并弄清楚英国人如何表达你心中的想法，那么它就不应该难学或无趣。

To study how the English people express an idea, and compare it with the Chinese way is always useful, and sometimes highly interesting.
研究英国人如何表达一个想法，并将其与中文方式进行比较，总是有益的，有时还非常有趣。

In everything we say, there are always (1) something to say, and (2) the way of saying it.
在我们所说的一切话语中，总是包含（1）要说的内容，和（2）表达的方式。

We shall call the former the notions, and the latter the expression of these notions.
我们将前者称为意念，后者称为这些意念的表达。

We must understand that grammar has no meaning for us except to teach us about these notions and the ways of expressing them.
我们必须理解，语法对我们来说，其意义仅在于教导我们这些意念及其表达方式。

In studying English grammar in this book, we shall always ask ourselves this question: If we have this idea, how shall we express it?
在本书中学习英语语法时，我们将始终问自己这个问题：如果我们有这个想法，我们该如何表达它？

### 1.11. All Grammatical Forms and Constructions are Ways of Expressing Notions
### 1.11. 所有语法形式和结构都是表达意念的方式

We must understand that all grammatical forms and constructions are simply ways of expressing notions.
我们必须理解，所有的语法形式和结构都仅仅是表达意念的方式。

If we have the idea that it's raining outside, we express this in Chinese by saying hsia-yu la (下雨了), or perhaps t'ien hsia-yu la (天下雨了), and in English by saying It rains.
如果我们有"外面在下雨"这个想法，我们用中文说"下雨了"，或者"天下雨了"来表达，而在英语中则说"It rains"。

But It rains means the same thing as hsia-yu la, although the way of saying it is different.
但是"It rains"和"下雨了"意思是相同的，尽管说法不同。

If we look closely, we see the English expression has a subject it, which is absent in the Chinese sentence.
如果我们仔细观察，会发现英语表达中有一个主语"it"，这在中文句子里是没有的。

We find also the letter s (pronounced [z]) added to the word rain, which is also not found in Chinese.
我们还发现字母"s"（发音为[z]）加在"rain"这个词后面，这在中文里也是没有的。

But the construction with it and -s is really only a means of expressing an idea or notion.
但是，带有"it"和"-s"的结构实际上只是一种表达想法或意念的手段。

In the following, we shall find the English language has different grammatical forms for the general idea It rains:
下面，我们将看到英语语言对于"下雨"这个普遍意念有不同的语法形式：

- It rains.                              下雨了.
- Does it rain?                          下雨了吗?
- Is it raining?                         正在下雨吗?
- It is going to rain.                   要下雨了.
- Has it rained?                         下过了雨吗?
- Did it rain?                           (昨天)下雨的吗?

You see the changes in Is it —ing? Has it —ed? Did it —? are not useless changes of form merely, but are the means of expressing notions.
你看，"Is it —ing?"、"Has it —ed?"、"Did it —?" 这些变化不仅仅是无用的形式变化，而是表达意念的手段。

Again take the sentences:
再来看这些句子：

He strikes me.     I strike him.
他打我。    我打他。

In Chinese, we would simply say:
在中文里，我们简单地说：

T'a ta wo (他打我). Wo ta t'a (我打他).
他打我。我打他。

English uses the forms me and him to express the persons that are objects of the verb strike.
英语使用"me"和"him"这些形式来表达动词"strike"的宾语人称。

But in Chinese, we express the same idea just as clearly by always putting the object behind the verb.
但在中文里，我们通过总是把宾语放在动词后面，同样清晰地表达了相同的意思。

This word-order in Chinese has the same grammatical value or purpose as the English distinction between I and me, he and him.
中文里的这种词序，与英语中"I"和"me"、"he"和"him"的区别具有相同的语法价值或目的。

Sometimes, this object-notion is expressed in Chinese by the use of pa, as in pa mên t'ui k'ai (把門推開, push open the door), pa jên ta ssŭ (把人打死, kill the man), and pa ch'ien ch'iang tsou (把錢搶走, rob his money).
有时，在中文里，这种宾语意念通过使用"把"来表达，例如"把門推開"、"把人打死"和"把錢搶走"。

The use of pa to introduce the object, therefore, may be regarded as a Chinese grammatical means for expressing the object-notion.
因此，使用"把"来引介宾语，可以被视为中文表达宾语意念的一种语法手段。

### 1.20. Grammar as the Science of Expression
### 1.20. 语法作为表达的科学

In the above, we have seen already that two languages may express the same notion or idea by different grammatical means.
以上，我们已经看到两种语言可能通过不同的语法手段来表达相同的意念或想法。

That is why the study of a foreign grammar should be very interesting, because it teaches us to compare the two languages, and helps us to express our ideas in the correct foreign way.
这就是为什么学习一门外语语法应该非常有趣，因为它教会我们比较两种语言，并帮助我们用地道的外语方式表达自己的想法。

Take, for instance, the group of notions called “Number.”
例如，以称为"数"的这组意念为例。

We find there are notions of indefinite number, like more than sixty, or 六十多, 六十餘.
我们发现存在不定数的意念，如"more than sixty"，或中文的"六十多"、"六十餘"。

Some Chinese students often make the mistake of saying sixty more, whereas the correct English way is to say over sixty, or sixty-odd.
一些中国学生常犯说"sixty more"的错误，而正确的英语表达方式是"over sixty"或"sixty-odd"。

The old-style grammars do not teach this, because the old-style grammars are interested only in the forms of singular and plural, like girl, girls / child, children.
旧式语法不教这个，因为旧式语法只对单复数的形式感兴趣，如"girl, girls / child, children"。

They do not bother about the rest when there is no change in word-form.
当词形没有变化时，它们就不关心其余的了。

We have to study this expression over sixty, because we start from the notion we wish to express, and here is an English expression that we must learn.
我们必须学习"over sixty"这个表达，因为我们从我们希望表达的意念出发，而这是一个我们必须学习的英语表达。

Again, the old-style grammars teach us that there are three degrees of comparison, like hot, hotter, hottest / early, earlier, earliest, because there are these three changes in word-form.
再者，旧式语法告诉我们比较级有三个等级，如"hot, hotter, hottest / early, earlier, earliest"，因为词形有这三种变化。

As a matter of fact, there are not only three, but a thousand varying degrees, and as many ways of expressing them, like less hot, not so very hot, rather hot, just hot enough, too hot, hot enough to burn your fingers, so hot that you can hardly breathe, as hot as a furnace, etc.
事实上，不仅有三级，而是有无数个变化的程度，以及同样多的表达方式，如"less hot"、"not so very hot"、"rather hot"、"just hot enough"、"too hot"、"hot enough to burn your fingers"、"so hot that you can hardly breathe"、"as hot as a furnace"等等。

All these expressions are as much a part of English grammar as the expressions hot, hotter, hottest.
所有这些表达，都和"hot, hotter, hottest"一样，是英语语法的一部分。

Again, among the notions of number, there is the Chinese notion of ch'eng (成) or tenths and there is the English notion of percentage: the correct English expression for pa-ch'eng-wu (八成五) is simply eighty-five per cent.
此外，在数的意念中，有中文的"成"或十分之几的概念，也有英语的百分比概念："八成五"的正确英语表达就是"eighty-five per cent"。

If we thus proceed from one group of notions to another, we shall soon learn all the important English forms of expression for the chief kinds of ideas and relationships.*
如果我们这样从一组意念到另一组意念地进行学习，我们很快就能学会表达主要想法和关系的所有重要英语形式。*

We shall thus study many things that are not found in the old-style grammar books.
因此，我们将学习许多旧式语法书中没有的内容。

And in the study of the changes in form, like It rains, It rained, It has rained, It has been raining, etc., which are found in the old-style grammars, we shall study them not as empty forms to be repeated and memorized, but as means of expressing some ideas which we have in our mind.
而在学习形式变化时，如"It rains"、"It rained"、"It has rained"、"It has been raining"等（这些在旧式语法中也有），我们将不把它们当作需要重复和记忆的空洞形式来学习，而是作为表达我们心中某些想法的手段来学习。

*Of course we cannot study all the expressions in the language, which is the work of the dictionary.
*当然，我们无法研究语言中的所有表达，那是词典的工作。

The difference between a book of grammar and a dictionary or book of phrases is that grammar deals with only the types or classes of expressions, and the dictionary deals with particular expressions.
语法书与词典或短语书的区别在于，语法只处理表达的类型或类别，而词典处理具体的表达。

According to Sweet, grammar deals with the general facts of language, lexicology with special facts.
根据斯威特的说法，语法处理语言的一般事实，词汇学处理特殊事实。

### 1.30. National Differences in Notions and Their Expressions
### 1.30. 意念及其表达的民族差异

All languages differ in their ways of expressing notions, and no one can say which language is right and which is wrong.
所有语言在表达意念的方式上都有所不同，没有人能说哪种语言是对的，哪种是错的。

All expressions are correct that serve to express our ideas clearly and adequately.
所有能够清晰、充分地表达我们想法的表达都是正确的。

*It rains, with a false subject, is as correct English as hsia-yu la, without any subject whatsoever, is correct Chinese.
带有假主语的"It rains"是地道的英语，就像没有任何主语的"下雨了"是地道的中文一样。

The English and Chinese languages differ both in notions and in their expressions.
英语和汉语在意念和表达上都有差异。

For instance, in Chinese, we can use the word peh both as an adjective and a noun, as in peh ma chih peh (白馬之白, Mencius), but in English, we have to say the whiteness of a white horse.
例如，在中文里，我们可以将"白"字既用作形容词也用作名词，如"白馬之白"（《孟子》），但在英语中，我们必须说"the whiteness of a white horse"。

On the other hand, in speaking of rich people and poor people, we may simply say the poor, the rich in English, but in Chinese we have to say p'in chek, fu chek (貧者, 富者) besides p'in-min, fu hu (貧民, 富戶).
另一方面，在谈到富人和穷人时，在英语中我们可以简单地说"the poor, the rich"，但在中文里，除了"貧民, 富戶"，我们还必须说"貧者, 富者"。

Again, it is perfectly all right to say t'a p'a (他怕, literally, “He afraid”) in Chinese, but in English, we have to add the connecting verb and say He is afraid.
再者，在中文里说"他怕"（字面意思是"He afraid"）是完全正确的，但在英语中，我们必须添加连系动词，说"He is afraid"。

These are differences in ways of expression.
这些是表达方式的差异。

### 1.31. English and Chinese Notions Differences
### 1.31. 英汉意念差异

Not only are English and Chinese expressions different, sometimes the notions themselves differ in the two languages.
不仅英汉表达方式不同，有时两种语言中的意念本身也存在差异。

Thus the vague idea expressed by should in I should think so is absent in Chinese, and to learn this expression, the Chinese student of English has first to learn the notion itself.
因此，"I should think so"中由"should"表达的模糊意念在中文里是没有的，要学习这个表达，中国的英语学习者首先必须学习这个意念本身。

This goes back to the English distinction between fact and fancy, and is a way of avoiding stating I think so too definitely as a fact.
这可以追溯到英语中对事实与设想的区分，是一种避免将"I think so"过于肯定地陈述为事实的方式。

There is the same notional distinction between It is all right and It would be all right, the latter being a more polite and less cocksure way of saying the former.
"It is all right"和"It would be all right"之间也存在同样的意念区别，后者是前者一种更礼貌、不那么武断的说法。

*Many Chinese students can never learn to use these expressions, because they are never taught this English distinction between fact and fancy.
*许多中国学生永远学不会使用这些表达，因为他们从未被教导过英语中事实与设想的这种区分。

On the other hand, we can think of Chinese notions which are not found in English.
另一方面，我们可以想到英语中没有的中文意念。

Thus the Chinese tentative action, as in ta-i-ta (打一打), or hsi-i-hsi (洗一洗), is difficult to express in English, because the English generally do not have this notion, although they sometimes express it in saying take a look, have a taste (=看一看, 尝一尝).
因此，中文里的尝试性动作，如"打一打"或"洗一洗"，很难用英语表达，因为英国人通常没有这种意念，尽管他们有时用"take a look"、"have a taste"（=看一看，尝一尝）来表达。

Our Chinese ideas of family relationships with a very sharp sense (or notion) of superiority and inferiority and sex distinction, as in the different ranks of brothers, cousins, nephews, uncles and aunts (哥哥, 弟弟, 表妹, 堂姊, 外甥, 姪女, 舅, 丈, 妗, 姨) are difficult to express in English, because the English people generally do not make much of such distinctions.
我们中国人关于家庭关系的观念，带有非常强烈的长幼尊卑和性别区分意识（或意念），例如兄弟、堂表兄弟姐妹、侄子外甥、叔伯舅姑姨（哥哥, 弟弟, 表妹, 堂姊, 外甥, 姪女, 舅, 丈, 妗, 姨）的不同等级，这些很难用英语表达，因为英国人通常不太注重这种区分。

In English, the wife’s brother, the husband’s brother, the older sister’s husband, and the younger sister’s husband are all called brothers-in-law.
在英语中，妻子的兄弟、丈夫的兄弟、姐姐的丈夫和妹妹的丈夫都称为"brothers-in-law"。

### 1.32. English Grammar Teaching English Ways
### 1.32. 英语语法教授英语思维方式

English grammar should, therefore, teach us the English ways of thinking and expression.
因此，英语语法应该教会我们英语的思维和表达方式。

We should learn to say the whiteness of a white horse (not white of white horse), over sixty (not sixty more), in three minutes (not three minutes more), I should think so (not always I think so), It would be all right (not always It is all right) and the poor and the rich (not always poor people and rich people).
我们应该学会说"the whiteness of a white horse"（而不是"white of white horse"）、"over sixty"（而不是"sixty more"）、"in three minutes"（而不是"three minutes more"）、"I should think so"（而不是总是说"I think so"）、"It would be all right"（而不是总是说"It is all right"）以及"the poor and the rich"（而不是总是说"poor people and rich people"）。

It should teach us always to say He is afraid (not He afraid), He becomes tired (not He tired), and always to say It rains, instead of the Chinese Rain already.
它应该教会我们总是说"He is afraid"（而不是"He afraid"）、"He becomes tired"（而不是"He tired"），并且总是说"It rains"，而不是中文式的"Rain already"。

To learn these English ways of thinking and expression is the object of our study of English grammar.
