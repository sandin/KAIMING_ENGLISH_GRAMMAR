## CHAPTER X: COMPARISON AND DEGREES
第十章：比较与等级

### 10.10. The Degrees of Comparison: The Relative Nature
### 10.10. 比较的等级：相对性

In English grammar, the usually recognized “degrees of comparison” of adjj. and advv. are three: positive, comparative and superlative, as represented by old, older, oldest, or good, better, best.
在英语语法中，通常认为形容词和副词的"比较等级"有三种：原级、比较级和最高级，例如 old, older, oldest, 或者 good, better, best。

Now these three degrees, it should be clearly understood, only refer to the formal endings, -er and -est, as regards the change in word-form; in no way do they exhaust the possible degrees of comparison in language, as regards its logical content.
现在应该清楚地理解，这三个等级仅指词形变化的形式词尾 -er 和 -est；就语言的逻辑内容而言，它们绝没有穷尽所有可能的比较等级。

Logically, there should be at least five degrees, namely, old, older, oldest, less old and least old.
从逻辑上讲，至少应该有五个等级，即：old, older, oldest, less old 和 least old。

Thus we have:—
因此我们有：—

stupid—{ more stupid—most stupid
stupid—{ more stupid—most stupid
         { less stupid—least stupid
         { less stupid—least stupid

Moreover, there are all sorts of words expressing indeterminate degrees, such as extremely, somewhat, more or less, in the actual language.
此外，在实际语言中，还有各种各样表达不确定程度的词，例如 extremely, somewhat, more or less。

These words are used, not for comparison among several objects, but for indicating degrees in a general way, as somewhat in “somewhat tired,” or with reference to some assumed standard, as too in too old for her, with her as the standard.
这些词不是用于在几个对象之间进行比较，而是用于一般性地表示程度，例如 "somewhat tired" 中的 somewhat；或者参照某个假定的标准，例如 "too old for her" 中的 too，这里"她"就是标准。

In this grammar, all such expressions and their use will be studied, because they are all means of expressing the notion of degree.
在本语法中，将研究所有此类表达及其用法，因为它们都是表达程度概念的手段。

It should also be noted that the comparative and superlative degrees are used only for comparison among several objects.
还应注意，比较级和最高级仅用于在几个对象之间进行比较。

A “better” man than Al Capone (American gangster) is not necessarily a “good” man, and a “more honest” man than the Minister of Communications may not be a really “honest” man at all.
一个比阿尔·卡彭（美国黑帮分子）"更好"的人不一定是个"好"人，一个比交通部长"更诚实"的人可能根本就不是一个真正"诚实"的人。

This student is “older” than that student, comparatively speaking, but, absolutely speaking, neither of them is really “old.”
比较而言，这个学生比那个学生"年纪大"，但绝对地说，他们俩都不是真的"老"。

So the positive degree (old) is really absolute, while the comparative and superlative degrees (older, oldest) are relative.
所以原级（old）是绝对的，而比较级和最高级（older, oldest）是相对的。

Thus we come to the conclusion that the “better” man is not better than the “good” man, and we shall find also the “best” man is not really better than the “better” man.
因此我们得出结论："更好"的人并不是比"好"人更好，我们还会发现"最好"的人也并不真的比"更好"的人更好。

The “best” man is simply “better” than all the rest.
"最好"的人只是比所有其他人都"更好"。

If A is thirteen, B is twelve and C is eleven, then, clearly, A is only older than B and C, although he the oldest.
如果A十三岁，B十二岁，C十一岁，那么很明显，A只是比B和C年纪大，尽管他是年纪最大的。

And then A really is not “old” at all.
而且A实际上根本不算"老"。

### 10.11. The “Three Degrees of Comparison”
### 10.11. "三个比较等级"

In English, we have the endings -er and -est for the comparative and superlative degrees, as in older, oldest, while there are no special endings to indicate the degrees expressed by less old and least old, which are often expressed by younger and youngest.
在英语中，我们有词尾 -er 和 -est 表示比较级和最高级，例如 older, oldest，而没有特殊的词尾来表示由 less old 和 least old 所表达的程度，这些程度通常用 younger 和 youngest 来表达。

Moreover, the longer words do not admit such endings, but are used with more and most.
此外，较长的词不接受这样的词尾，而是与 more 和 most 连用。

The general rules are:—
一般规则是：—

(1) Words of one syllable can always have “-er” and “-est.”
(1) 单音节词总是可以加 "-er" 和 "-est"。

E.g.—
例如：—
great          broad          new          deep
great          broad          new          deep
greater        broader        newer        deeper
greater        broader        newer        deeper
greatest       broadest       newest       deepest
greatest       broadest       newest       deepest

Sometimes it is possible to use the words more and most.
有时也可以使用 more 和 most。

Thus sound, sounder, soundest is always correct, but we sometimes say, “This is a more sound proposition.”
因此 sound, sounder, soundest 总是正确的，但我们有时会说："This is a more sound proposition."

(2) Words of two syllables sometimes take “-er” and “-est” and sometimes “more” and “most.”
(2) 双音节词有时加 "-er" 和 "-est"，有时用 "more" 和 "most"。

E.g.—
例如：—
clever          narrow          happy          lovely
clever          narrow          happy          lovely
cleverer        narrower        happier        lovelier
cleverer        narrower        happier        lovelier
cleverest       narrowest       happiest       loveliest
cleverest       narrowest       happiest       loveliest

stupid          cunning         learned
stupid          cunning         learned
more stupid     more cunning    more learned
more stupid     more cunning    more learned
most stupid     most cunning    most learned
most stupid     most cunning    most learned

There are no clear rules for this difference, except established usage and a vague sense of euphony, which is again based on usage.
对于这种区别没有明确的规则，除了既定的用法和基于用法的模糊的悦耳感。

Thus we have cleverer, cleverest, but more proper, most proper, and not properer, properest.
因此我们有 cleverer, cleverest，但是用 more proper, most proper，而不用 properer, properest。

We might say handsomer or more handsome, and commoner or more common, but we could never say cunninger or learneder or honester.
我们可能说 handsomer 或 more handsome，以及 commoner 或 more common，但我们绝不能说 cunninger 或 learneder 或 honester。

The -y ending seems always to go well with the -er and -est, as dirtier, healthier, crazier, lazier, funnier (but usually more sticky and not stickier).
以 -y 结尾的词似乎总是能与 -er 和 -est 很好地搭配，例如 dirtier, healthier, crazier, lazier, funnier（但通常用 more sticky，而不用 stickier）。

The only comparatively clear rule seems to be that the endings -able, -ible, -ful, -ing can never take on the -er, -est additions.
唯一比较明确的规则似乎是，以 -able, -ible, -ful, -ing 结尾的词绝不能加 -er, -est。

Thus formations like laughabler, awfuller, cunninger are practically unknown in English.
因此，像 laughabler, awfuller, cunninger 这样的构词在英语中几乎不存在。

Advv. in -ly (except early) always have “more” and “most,” as more rarely, most surely.
以 -ly 结尾的副词（除了 early）总是用 "more" 和 "most"，例如 more rarely, most surely。

(3) Words of three or more syllables generally take “more” and “most,” and only rarely -er, -est.
(3) 三个或更多音节的词通常用 "more" 和 "most"，很少用 -er, -est。

E.g.—
例如：—
beautiful       convenient      interesting
beautiful       convenient      interesting
more beautiful  more convenient more interesting
more beautiful  more convenient more interesting
most beautiful  most convenient most interesting
most beautiful  most convenient most interesting

generous        incomplete      comprehensive
generous        incomplete      comprehensive
more generous   more incomplete more comprehensive
more generous   more incomplete more comprehensive
most generous   most incomplete most comprehensive
most generous   most incomplete most comprehensive

Exceptionally, however, we do sometimes use -er and -est for emphasis, e.g., “This is the confoundedest problem I ever came across,” which is more expressive than most confounded.
然而，例外情况下，我们有时确实会用 -er 和 -est 来表示强调，例如："This is the confoundedest problem I ever came across," 这比 most confounded 表达力更强。

Such cases are really abnormal deviations from the regular rule for some special reasons of rhetoric.
这种情况实际上是出于某种修辞的特殊原因而对常规规则的异常偏离。

NOTE.—When we add the ending -er or -est to words ending in -y, we change the y into i, when it follows a consonant, but keep it unchanged, if it follows a vowel: thus, happier, lazier, clumsier, but gayer, coyer.
注意：当我们给以 -y 结尾的词加 -er 或 -est 时，如果 y 前面是辅音，我们把 y 变成 i；如果前面是元音，则保持不变：因此，happier, lazier, clumsier, 但是 gayer, coyer。

Phonetically, gayer retains the original “long a” sound, which is not lowered as in prayer (=禱文): gayer rhymes with layer (n.), and not with mayor, prayer, there, care.
从语音上讲，gayer 保留了原来的"长 a"音，这个音不像 prayer（=禱文）中的音那样降低：gayer 与 layer (名词) 押韵，而不与 mayor, prayer, there, care 押韵。

A single final consonant preceded by a single vowel is doubled when -er or -est is added to it: thus thinner, fatter, but quicker and cheaper.
当词尾是单个辅音字母且其前是单个元音字母时，加 -er 或 -est 时需双写该辅音字母：因此 thinner, fatter, 但是 quicker 和 cheaper。

### 10.12. “More Better,” “Next Best,” etc.
### 10.12. "More Better"、"Next Best"等

Two cases are worthy of special mention.
有两种情况值得特别提及。

In vulgar speech, and among Chinese students, the phrase “more better” is often used.
在粗俗言语中，以及在中国学生中，经常使用 "more better" 这个短语。

This is not in accordance with good usage, although it can be found in Shakespeare, who also gives us “the most unkindest cut of all.”
这不符合良好的用法，尽管在莎士比亚的作品中可以找到这种用法，他也给我们留下了 "the most unkindest cut of all"。

The psychological reason for this mistake is the desire for clearness and emphasis.
这种错误的心理原因是渴望清晰和强调。

On the other hand, the expressions “next best,” “second best,” “third best” are perfectly good and very convenient forms of expression, equivalent to Chinese 第二好, 第三好.
另一方面，"next best"、"second best"、"third best" 这些表达是完全正确且非常方便的表达形式，相当于中文的"第二好"、"第三好"。

English has also the expression the largest but one (two, three) equivalent to Chinese 第二大 (第三, 第四大) respectively.
英语也有 the largest but one (two, three) 的表达，分别相当于中文的"第二大"（第三、第四大）。

For emphasis, we have the expressions, the very best, the very worst, the very first and the very last.
为了强调，我们有 the very best, the very worst, the very first 和 the very last 这些表达。

The word possible is also often added to a superlative in -est to emphasize its meaning:—
possible 这个词也经常加在以 -est 结尾的最高级后面以强调其含义：—

the best possible man for the job
最适合这份工作的人
the worst possible combination of fools and knaves
傻瓜和无赖最糟糕的组合
by the quickest possible route
通过尽可能最快的路线
at the earliest possible opportunity
一有机会就
make the greatest possible allowance
做出尽可能最大的让步

### 10.13. Superiority, Equality and Inferiority
### 10.13. 优等、同等和劣等

From §10.10 that a more logical division of the degrees of comparison should be on the basis of equality or inequality, as suggested by Jespersen.
从第10.10节可知，正如叶斯柏森所建议的，比较等级的更合乎逻辑的划分应基于相等或不相等。

On this basis, we should have the three degrees:—
在此基础上，我们应有以下三个等级：—

1. (>) older than . . . . . . . . (Superiority)
1. (>) older than . . . . . . . . (优等)
2. (=) as old as . . . . . . . . . (Equality)
2. (=) as old as . . . . . . . . . (同等)
3. (<) less old than . . . . . . . (Inferiority)
3. (<) less old than . . . . . . . (劣等)

Notice that in expressing equality, we use the conj. phrase as . . . as, but in expressing superiority or inferiority, we use the conj. than.
注意在表达同等时，我们使用连词短语 as ... as，但在表达优等或劣等时，我们使用连词 than。

Instead of the pair as . . . as, so . . . as may also be used.
除了 as ... as 这对词，也可以使用 so ... as。

Moreover, we can put in a n. between the pair, as well as between -er . . . than.
此外，我们可以在 as ... as 这对词之间插入一个名词，在 -er ... than 之间也可以。

E.g.—
例如：—

He is as good a player as Morley.
他和莫利一样是个好球员。
He is a better player than Morley.
他是一个比莫利更好的球员。

Very often, especially in the colloquial style, the phrase introduced by than or as is dropped as being understood.
很多时候，尤其是在口语体中，由 than 或 as 引导的短语因为意思明确而被省略。

But this will do just as well (as that one).
但这个（和那个一样）也行。
It is even better (than that one).
它甚至（比那个）更好。
Are they as keen about it (as we are here)?
他们（和我们这里一样）对此热衷吗？
But this is just as good an opportunity.
但这同样是个好机会。
I don't think you can find a better substitute.
我认为你找不到更好的替代品了。
Oh, no, he is not as (stressed) old, but older.
哦，不，他不是（重读）那么老，而是更老。

Exercise 87. Change the following sentences, using the conjn. as . . . as, or -er (more) . . . than, with a n. in between.
练习87. 用连词 as ... as 或 -er (more) ... than 改写下列句子，并在其中插入一个名词。

1. Mr Harding and his wife are equally great gamblers.
1. 哈丁先生和他的妻子同样是狂热的赌徒。
2. In playing chess, Flexner is better than Harris.
2. 下棋方面，弗莱克斯纳比哈里斯强。
3. Your correction and the original sentence are equally bad.
3. 你的修改和原句同样糟糕。
4. He and Hopkins are equally fast writers.
4. 他和霍普金斯同样是写作速度快的人。
5. Hopkins does not write as fast as Murry.
5. 霍普金斯写作速度不如默里快。

The Latin comparatives superior, inferior, prior, senior, junior are followed by to and not by than, e.g., prior to this event, superior to him in business ability.
拉丁语源的比较级 superior, inferior, prior, senior, junior 后面接 to 而不是 than，例如：prior to this event, superior to him in business ability。

For other than, see §8.20.
关于 other than，见 §8.20。

### 10.14. Implied Comparison
### 10.14. 隐含的比较

There are a few adj. which are used only in the comparative and superlative degrees, and which cannot be followed by than.
有一些形容词仅用于比较级和最高级，并且后面不能接 than。

These are all words denoting direction: inner, outer, nether, upper, and innermost, outermost (outmost, utmost), nethermost (rare), uppermost.
这些都是表示方向的词：inner, outer, nether, upper, 以及 innermost, outermost (outmost, utmost), nethermost (罕见), uppermost。

We say the inner circle or the outer circle, but cannot say “This circle is outer than that one.”
我们说 the inner circle 或 the outer circle，但不能说 "This circle is outer than that one."

The comparison is implied.
比较是隐含的。

Notice that the words in the positive degree for these adj. are all prepp. or advv.—in, out, beneath, up.
注意这些形容词的原级词都是介词或副词——in, out, beneath, up。

Former and latter also cannot be followed by than: the former president, the latter half, but never former than or latter than.
Former 和 latter 后面也不能接 than：the former president, the latter half，但绝不用 former than 或 latter than。

Latter refers to what comes behind in space, while later refers to what comes behind in time: the latter half of the book, but the later period.
Latter 指空间上在后面的，而 later 指时间上在后面的：the latter half of the book,
