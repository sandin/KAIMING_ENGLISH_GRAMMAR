## CHAPTER XIII TIME OF ACTION
## 第十三章 动作的时间

### 13.10. The Time Scheme: Present, Past and Future
### 13.10. 时间体系：现在、过去与未来

The usual division of time is into the three main classes: present, past and future, as represented by I saw, I see and I shall see.
通常的时间划分分为三大类：现在、过去和未来，以"I saw"、"I see"和"I shall see"为代表。

In each of these three main divisions, one can state that something has already taken place before it, and something is going to take place after it.
在这三个主要划分的每一个中，都可以陈述某事在其之前已经发生，以及某事在其之后将要发生。

Thus we get nine tenses altogether, as shown in the following scheme:
因此我们总共得到九种时态，如下表所示：

- Before-past: I had seen
- 先过去时：I had seen

- Simple past: I saw
- 简单过去时：I saw

- After-past: I was (going) to see
- 后过去时：I was (going) to see

- Before-present: I have seen
- 先现在时：I have seen

- Simple present: I see
- 简单现在时：I see

- After-present: I am going to see / I shall see
- 后现在时：I am going to see / I shall see

- Before-future: I shall have seen
- 先将来时：I shall have seen

- Simple future: I shall see / I am going to see
- 简单将来时：I shall see / I am going to see

- After-future: I shall be going to see
- 后将来时：I shall be going to see

Notice that there is an overlapping in the central division "present."
请注意，在中心的"现在"划分中存在重叠。

"Before-present" is really past, and "after-present" is really future.
"先现在时"实际上是过去，而"后现在时"实际上是将来。

In English, the distinction between before-present and past is preserved through the forms I saw and I have seen, whereas in French, for instance, "I have seen" (j'ai vu) is regularly used for the past.
在英语中，通过"I saw"和"I have seen"的形式保留了先现在时和过去时的区别，而在法语中，例如，"I have seen" (j'ai vu) 通常被用作过去时。

Whether the grammatical distinction is maintained or not, the action itself really took place in the past.
无论语法上的区别是否被保持，动作本身确实发生在过去。

On the other hand, the after-present and the future really come together in English, because what comes after the present is naturally in the future.
另一方面，在英语中，后现在时和将来时实际上是重合的，因为在现在之后发生的事情自然属于将来。

However, a slight distinction is noticeable.
然而，可以注意到一个细微的区别。

There is a difference between I am going to do it now or I shall do it now (after-present) and I am going to do it tomorrow or I shall do it tomorrow (simple future).
"I am going to do it now" 或 "I shall do it now"（后现在时）与 "I am going to do it tomorrow" 或 "I shall do it tomorrow"（简单将来时）之间存在区别。

Notice that, on account of the fact that the past of shall (should) has a non-temporal use (i.e., not pertaining to time proper), it is defective and cannot be used for the after-past and cannot alone form the after-future.
请注意，由于"shall"的过去式"should"具有非时间性用法（即，不恰当地与时间相关），它是有缺陷的，不能用于后过去时，也不能单独构成后将来时。

On the other hand, the expression be going to gives us a perfect conjugation in all tenses.
另一方面，"be going to"这个表达为我们提供了在所有时态中的完整变位。

Actually, be going to is as important a form for expressing future action as shall or will.
实际上，"be going to"是表达将来动作的一种与"shall"或"will"同等重要的形式。

Again, actions may last a long time.
再者，动作可能持续很长时间。

Hence, we get another scheme of durative tenses:
因此，我们得到另一套持续时态的体系：

- Before-past: I had been seeing
- 先过去时：I had been seeing

- Past: I was seeing
- 过去时：I was seeing

- Before-present: I have been seeing
- 先现在时：I have been seeing

- Present: I am seeing
- 现在时：I am seeing

- Before-future: I shall have been seeing
- 先将来时：I shall have been seeing

- Future: I shall be seeing
- 将来时：I shall be seeing

In this case, what is before-present really started in the past and is continued down to the present.
在这种情况下，先现在时实际上始于过去并持续到现在。

Before-future has very little actual use.
先将来时实际使用很少。

### 13.20. What is Present?
### 13.20. 什么是现在？

If we imagine time as flowing in a straight line, and try to fix the limit for the "present," we immediately see that it occupies an infinitesimal, ever-fleeting point of time only.
如果我们把时间想象成一条直线流动，并试图确定"现在"的界限，我们立刻看到它只占据了一个无限小、不断消逝的时间点。

Logically, that time we call present is just a bare second, whereas all that goes before it belongs to the past (even the last second) and all that comes after it belongs to the future (including the next second).
从逻辑上讲，我们称之为现在的时间仅仅是一秒钟，而在它之前的所有时间都属于过去（即使是最后一秒），在它之后的所有时间都属于未来（包括下一秒）。

It is because of this fact that the present always encroaches upon the territory of the past or the future.
正是因为这个事实，现在总是侵占过去或未来的领域。

I have just seen him, nominally called the present, really indicates a past action, and I shall do it now indicates really that the action will take place in the future.
"I have just seen him"，名义上称为现在时，实际上表示一个过去的动作，而"I shall do it now"实际上表示该动作将发生在未来。

It is, therefore, very difficult to "do" anything in the present.
因此，很难在现在"做"任何事情。

There are very few things that can be done in the present second.
在当下这一秒能做的事情非常少。

Hence, we practically never express really present action by the simple present, and use instead the present continuous: I am doing it now, which expresses an extended period.
因此，我们实际上从不使用简单现在时来表达真正的现在动作，而是使用现在进行时：I am doing it now，它表达的是一个延长的时段。

The result is, either we have done a thing, or are going to do it, or we are doing it right now.
结果是，我们要么已经做了一件事，要么打算去做它，要么我们正在做它。

For fuller illustrations, see § 11.10.
更完整的说明，见 § 11.10。

### 13.21. Habitual Action and Eternal Truths
### 13.21. 习惯性动作与永恒真理

Actually, however, we do regard the present as something more than a mere point of time.
然而，实际上，我们确实将现在视为不仅仅是时间上的一个点。

We often mean by it today, or the present week, or even the present year.
我们通常用它指今天，或本周，甚至今年。

For instance, we say I am staying at the X Hotel this week, or We dine at eight this year, last year we dined at seven.
例如，我们说"I am staying at the X Hotel this week"，或者"We dine at eight this year, last year we dined at seven"。

The last example indicates not really present action, but merely a present habit.
最后一个例子表示的并非真正的现在动作，而仅仅是当前的习惯。

Or in the case of words like know, believe, think and be (I know you are right / I believe you are wrong), the suggestion is really that knowing or believing covers a long time.
或者对于像"know"、"believe"、"think"和"be"这样的词（I know you are right / I believe you are wrong），其含义实际上是知道或相信涵盖了一段很长的时间。

Or again, we may express an eternal truth when we say The earth moves around the sun, or at least a general statement when we say A carriage has four wheels / A hansom has two wheels / A statue stands in the yard / The Japanese eat a lot of beans and fish / Bread is made from flour / If you take the plug off, the current is cut off / There is not enough ventilation in this room.
再者，当我们说"The earth moves around the sun"时，我们可能表达的是一个永恒真理，或者至少当我们说"A carriage has four wheels / A hansom has two wheels / A statue stands in the yard / The Japanese eat a lot of beans and fish / Bread is made from flour / If you take the plug off, the current is cut off / There is not enough ventilation in this room"时，表达的是一个一般性陈述。

For this reason, we see that the simple present in English is used to express habitual actions like know and love that cover a long time, and eternal truths or general statements.
因此，我们看到英语中的简单现在时用于表达像"know"和"love"这样持续很长时间的习惯性动作，以及永恒真理或一般性陈述。

But it is never used to express really present action.
但它从不用于表达真正的现在动作。

When a man is killing a boy unintentionally, say to him, "You are killing the boy!" and not "You kill the boy!" although the killing may take only a fraction of a second.
当一个人无意中正在杀死一个男孩时，对他说："You are killing the boy!" 而不是 "You kill the boy!"，尽管杀死可能只花费几分之一秒。

(See §11.10.)
（见 §11.10。）

### 13.30. Expression of Future
### 13.30. 将来的表达

Future action differs from present action in that it has not yet actually taken place, and hence the action is not an accomplished fact, but a wish, an obligation, a possibility or an expectation merely: He will go / He shall go / He may go / He expects to go.
将来动作与现在动作的不同之处在于它尚未实际发生，因此该动作不是一个已完成的事实，而仅仅是一个愿望、义务、可能性或期望：He will go / He shall go / He may go / He expects to go。

There is always more or less an element of uncertainty or intention in it.
其中总是或多或少包含不确定或意图的成分。

The purest form is what we call "simple future": He will die soon, or He is going to die soon.
最纯粹的形式是我们称之为"简单将来时"的形式：He will die soon，或者 He is going to die soon。

These forms may be arranged under the following heads:
这些形式可以按以下类别排列：

(1) Simple future: I shall come again / He will die soon.
(1) 简单将来时：I shall come again / He will die soon。

(2) Intention: I will come again.
(2) 意图：I will come again。

(3) Command: Come! / You shall come this afternoon.
(3) 命令：Come! / You shall come this afternoon。

(4) Possibility: I may come again.
(4) 可能性：I may come again。

(5) Obligation: I am to see him this afternoon.
(5) 义务：I am to see him this afternoon。

### 13.31. "Shall" and "Will"
### 13.31. "Shall" 和 "Will"

The English shall and will seem to cause a great deal of difficulty among Chinese students.
英语中的"shall"和"will"似乎给中国学生带来了很多困难。

The clearest and simplest explanation is to arrange them under the three heads: command, intention and simple future.
最清晰和最简单的解释是将它们按三个类别排列：命令、意图和简单将来时。

SIMPLE FUTURE                     COMMAND
简单将来时                         命令
I shall          we shall          Always shall
I shall          we shall          总是用 shall
you will         you will
you will         you will
he }                               INTENTION
he }                               意图
she } will        they will        Always will
she } will        they will        总是用 will
it }
it }

As examples of COMMAND, we have: You shall be punished for this / He shall be kept indoors / Each one shall have two eggs for his breakfast / You shan't see her again.
作为命令的例子，我们有：You shall be punished for this / He shall be kept indoors / Each one shall have two eggs for his breakfast / You shan't see her again。

As no one gives commands to himself, therefore the forms I shall, we shall are not found in the sense of commands.
由于没有人对自己下命令，因此"I shall"、"we shall"的形式不用于命令的意义。

Instead of we shall, the form let's is used: Let's go.
代替"we shall"，使用"let's"的形式：Let's go。

As examples of INTENTION, we have: I will come again / They will come tonight / He has decided that he will not stay here any longer.
作为意图的例子，我们有：I will come again / They will come tonight / He has decided that he will not stay here any longer。

As examples of SIMPLE FUTURE, we have: I shall be going soon / I shall be away tomorrow / You will be sorry for this / The school will close soon / It will rain soon / Tomorrow will be Saturday / It will be impossible to do anything tonight.
作为简单将来时的例子，我们有：I shall be going soon / I shall be away tomorrow / You will be sorry for this / The school will close soon / It will rain soon / Tomorrow will be Saturday / It will be impossible to do anything tonight。

In asking questions, use the word which you expect in the answer.
在提问时，使用你期望在回答中出现的词。

Shall you be here tonight?       I shall.
Shall you be here tonight?       I shall。
Will you come again?            I will.
Will you come again?            I will。
Shall they come, too?           They shan't.
Shall they come, too?           They shan't。
Shall I tell him?               Do. (You shall.)
Shall I tell him?               Do. (You shall。)
Will he die?                   I'm afraid he will.
Will he die?                   I'm afraid he will。

The important thing is to form the habit of using I shall and we shall for simple future instead of I will (and shall I? in questions instead of will I?).
重要的是要养成在简单将来时使用"I shall"和"we shall"的习惯，而不是"I will"（以及在疑问句中用"shall I?"而不是"will I?"）。

Say I shall not be able to and not I will not be able to, because this is simple future, for be able is not something that you can "will."
说"I shall not be able to"而不是"I will not be able to"，因为这是简单将来时，因为"be able"不是你可以"will"的东西。

There is a tendency in modern English to use I'll for I shall (indicating simple future), because I'll is shorter and easier to pronounce: as I am afraid I'll die soon (strictly I shall).
现代英语中有一种趋势，用"I'll"代替"I shall"（表示简单将来时），因为"I'll"更短且更容易发音：例如 I am afraid I'll die soon（严格来说是 I shall）。

This is especially true of American and Scotch usage.
这在美国和苏格兰用法中尤其如此。

But one should nevertheless form the habit first of following the correct usage of using I shall.
但人们仍应首先养成遵循正确用法使用"I shall"的习惯。

Will and shall are usually pronounced [l] and [ʃeːl] or [ʃ-ːl] respectively: I'll [ail], he'll [hiːl], they'll [ðeil], I shall [ai ʃel].
"Will"和"shall"通常分别发音为[l]和[ʃeːl]或[ʃ-ːl]：I'll [ail], he'll [hiːl], they'll [ðeil], I shall [ai ʃel]。

Shan't is pronounced with a clear [ɑː]: You shan't [ʃɑːnt] do this.
"Shan't"发音带有清晰的[ɑː]：You shan't [ʃɑːnt] do this。

There is a special use of will, meaning "insist," which is always pronounced full [wil].
"Will"有一个特殊用法，意思是"坚持"，总是完整发音为[wil]。

I told him not to go, but he will go (i.e., he insists on going).
I told him not to go, but he will go（即，他坚持要去）。

Boys will be boys (i.e., you can't expect boys to behave like grown-ups).
Boys will be boys（即，你不能指望男孩表现得像成年人一样）。

But things will happen against our wish.
但事情总会违背我们的意愿发生。

Also as a full vb. (not as an auxiliary), will is pronounced full: God wills (willed) [wilz (wild)] that it should be so.
同样，作为一个实义动词（不是助动词），"will"完整发音：God wills (willed) [wilz (wild)] that it should be so。

Exercise 102. Fill in shall or will in the following sentences expressing simple future:
练习 102. 在下列表达简单将来时的句子中填入 shall 或 will：
