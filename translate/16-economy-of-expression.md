## 第十六章 表达的经济性

### 16.10. 简洁与经济

Proficiency in any language means a certain ease in handling its sentence forms and constructions.
精通任何语言都意味着能够轻松驾驭其句型结构。

The foreign student is apt to err on the side of stiffness and over-correctness of expression.
外国学生容易在表达上显得生硬和过度规范。

He says, for instance, “you must not” instead of “you mustn’t,” and “if it is possible” instead of “if possible.”
例如，他们会说“you must not”而非“you mustn’t”，说“if it is possible”而非“if possible”。

These simpler forms, however, are used to a very large extent by the native speakers, for every language has naturally evolved certain omissions and short cuts which make for ease and economy.
然而这些简化形式在母语者中使用极为普遍，因为每种语言都自然演化出某些省略与简略方式以实现简洁经济。

The English language, in particular, is marked by its love of economy and simplicity of construction, for the Englishman does not use more words than is strictly necessary for his purpose.
英语尤其以追求结构的经济简洁著称，因为英国人从不为达意而使用冗余词汇。

It is therefore very appropriate that we should conclude our study of English grammar with a review of its various word-saving and energy-saving devices.
因此我们以回顾各类省词省力的表达方式作为英语语法研究的结语，实为恰当之举。

### 16.20. 功能转换

A noun generally makes for simpler and shorter sentences than other parts of speech.
名词通常比其他词类更能构建简洁短小的句子。

Compare the following sentences:
比较下列句子：

- I saw hatred in his eyes. Or: His eyes seemed to show hatred.
  我在他眼中看到了仇恨。或：他的眼神似乎显露着仇恨。

- His eyes seem to show that he hated me.
  他的眼神似乎表明他憎恨我。

- I have no fear of his running away.
  我不担心他会逃跑。

- I am not afraid that he may run away.
  我不害怕他可能逃跑。

- Cleanliness is next to holiness.
  洁净近于神圣。

- To be clean is next in importance to to be holy. (A bad sentence)
  保持洁净的重要性仅次于保持神圣。（劣句）

- There's comfort for one's soul in smoking.
  吸烟能慰藉心灵。

- When one smokes, one's soul feels comforted. (A bad sentence)
  当人吸烟时，心灵会感到慰藉。（劣句）

- Strive for simplicity of style.
  力求文风简练。

- Strive to be simple when you write.
  写作时力求简洁。

- Punctuality often means a waste of time in China.
  守时在中国常意味着浪费时间。

- To be punctual in China means that you often have to waste your time waiting for others.
  在中国守时意味着你常需浪费时间等候他人。

- He makes a virtue of necessity.
  他把必须做的事装成出于好心做的。

- Because he has to do it, he is making it appear that he loves doing it.
  因为他不得不做，便装作自己乐于为之。

In all the above pairs of sentences, it is easily seen that the first example is neater, shorter, and on the whole a much better sentence than the second example.
通过以上各组句子可明显看出，首例总是比次例更简洁短小，整体而言是更优的句式。

### 16.21. 从句转为短语

In consequence of the relative simplicity of nouns and complexity of finite verbs (which entail with them a subject and perhaps an object), phrases which are without a verb and subject are shorter and neater than clauses.
由于名词相对简单而限定动词较为复杂（需附带主语或宾语），不含动词和主语的短语比从句更简短精炼。

This is especially true of prepositional phrases.
介词短语尤其如此。

The two words for fun can stand for he was not serious in, and the two words by necessity can take the place of the clause because he had to do it.
两个词“for fun”可替代“he was not serious in”，而“by necessity”能取代从句“because he had to do it”。

Do it by turn is much shorter than You do it first and the others will do it one after another.
“Do it by turn”远比“You do it first and the others will do it one after another”简练。

During his absence is shorter than while he was away.
“During his absence”短于“while he was away”。

In English, there are many pairs of prepositions and conjunctions which have the same meaning.
英语中存在许多意义相同的介词与连词组合。

| Prepositions | Conjunctions |
|-------------|-------------|
| on account of his illness or because of illness | because he was ill |
| 因其患病 | 因为他生病了 |
| during his illness | while he was ill |
| 在他患病期间 | 当他生病时 |
| against, despite, in spite of my advice | although I advised him to the contrary |
| 违背我的建议 | 尽管我劝他不要如此 |
| for all my trouble, with all your trouble | although I (you) took so much trouble |
| 尽管我（你）费尽周折 | 虽然我（你）付出诸多努力 |
| for the purpose of, by way of, with a view to | in order that, so that, that |
| 为了 | 以便 |
| out of gratefulness, jealousy | because one felt grateful, jealous |
| 出于感激、嫉妒 | 因为感到感激、嫉妒 |
| with that, he went away | after he said that, he, etc. |
| 言毕他便离去 | 他说完那话后便... |
| with your permission | if you allow me |
| 若蒙允许 | 如果您允许我 |
| to my surprise | (I was surprised to) |
| 令我惊讶的是 | （我惊讶地...） |
| upon seeing me there | when he saw me there |
| 一见到我在那儿 | 当他看见我在那儿时 |
| on hearing this | when he heard this |
| 闻听此事 | 当他听到这事时 |
| but for my help | if I had not helped him |
| 若非我的帮助 | 如果我不曾帮他 |
| like me | as I do it |
| 如我一般 | 像我这样做 |
| after examination | after it was examined |
| 经检查后 | 在被检查之后 |
| before coming | before one came |
| 到来之前 | 在某人到来前 |
| since his departure | since he left |
| 自他离开后 | 自从他离开以来 |

Many verbs and adjectives may be followed by a prepositional phrase, an infinitive phrase or by a clause beginning with that.
许多动词和形容词后可接介词短语、不定式短语或以that引导的从句。

- I am sure of his coming.
  我确信他会来。

- I am sure to meet him.
  我肯定会遇见他。

- I am sure that he will come.
  我确信他会来。

  他不敢赴死。

  得知他们不在意，他很失望。

- He was disappointed that they took no interest in it.
  他们对此毫无兴趣，这让他失望。

### 16.22. 短语修饰语转为单词修饰语

Many phrases are used as modifiers and can be converted into word-modifiers.
许多短语作修饰语时可转换为单词修饰语。

Thus, instead of saying “We are living in a China torn by civil wars,” one might write more simply “We are living in a war-torn China.”
例如，用“We are living in a war-torn China”替代“We are living in a China torn by civil wars”更为简练。

“If you go through the famine-stricken district” is simpler and better than “if you go through the district stricken by famine.”
“If you go through the famine-stricken district”比“if you go through the district stricken by famine”更简洁优美。

How such modifiers are formed has already been fully explained under § 9.26.
此类修饰语的构成方式已在§9.26中详述。

### 16.30. 助词省略

A few examples should suffice here:
以下数例足以说明：

- They had come and (had) gone.
  他们来了又（已）离去。

- He had inherited and (had) spent a fortune.
  他继承并（已）挥霍了一笔财富。

- She was trying to start a ball, and he (was trying) to prevent it.
  她试图发起舞会，而他（正试图）阻止。

- She was trying to get into society, and he (was trying) to get away from it.
  她努力跻身上流社会，而他（正努力）逃离其中。

### 16.31. 主要词语省略

This kind of ellipsis is especially common in answers to questions.
此类省略在问答中尤为常见。

- Would you join? I should love to (join you).
  你愿意加入吗？我很乐意（加入你们）。

  我想炸鸡或烤土豆，但不知如何（操作）。

  我去了恩菲尔德（家或商店）。

### 16.32. 从句中的省略

Dependent clauses are often subject to all sorts of mutilations in English (see § 9.82).
英语从句常出现各种成分省略（参见§9.82）。

- I’ll come, if (it is) possible.
  如果（情况）允许我会来。

- Wash it in water, pick out the small particles, if (there’s) any, and sun it in the air. Take it in, when (it is) dry. Replace it, if (it is) necessary.
  用水清洗，如有（任何）小颗粒需挑出，置于阳光下晾晒。（它）干燥后收回，必要时更换。

  （你）有疑问时请查阅词典。

- Although (he was) the youngest of the class, he captured all the prizes.
  尽管（他是）全班最年幼的，他囊括了所有奖项。

Note also the frequent dropping of that in clauses:
注意从句中常省略that：

  他说（他）会来。

- I saw (that) he could not do it.
  我看（出）他无法完成。

- He said (that) he had received word (that) Millie was not coming.
  他说（他）已收到消息（说）米莉不来了。

The relative pronoun that is also dropped when used as an object (§ 9.68):
关系代词that作宾语时也会省略（§9.68）：

- The man (that) you saw.
  你见过的（那个）人。

- He was not the man (that) I wanted.
  他不是我想要的（那个）人。

- He was the one (that) you were asking for.
  他就是你找的（那个）人。

- The things we have are not the things we want, and the things we want are not the things we have.
  我们拥有的不是我们想要的，我们想要的不是我们拥有的。

The tendency to shorten dependent clauses has also brought about the use of words like as and but as relative pronouns:
缩短从句的趋势还催生了as和but作关系代词的用法：

- He came to apologize, as was expected.
  如预料的那样，他来道歉了。

- Anyway, he lost his job, as has been mentioned above.
  总之，如前所述，他失去了工作。

- There is no one but admires his courage.
  无人不钦佩他的勇气。

### 16.33. “And that”结构

In English, the phrase “and that” may stand for a whole preceding clause.
英语中“and that”可指代前文整个从句。

E.g.:
例如：

- The poor boy was ordered to go out and fetch water, and that (i.e., go out and fetch water) on a stormy night like this.
  这可怜的男孩被命令出去打水，而且（即出去打水）是在这样的暴风雨之夜。

- You had better pay up, and that (pay up) immediately.
  你最好付清款项，而且（付清）立即执行。

### 16.40. 缩写与缩约形式

The contracted forms like isn’t, aren’t, won’t, wouldn’t, shan’t, can’t, are so common that they are part of the daily language.
isn’t, aren’t, won’t, wouldn’t, shan’t, can’t等缩约形式极为常见，已成为日常用语的一部分。

In fact, they have become the regular colloquial forms, so much so that when an Englishman says I shall not or I cannot, it suggests a slight emphasis on not.
事实上它们已成为标准口语形式，以至于当英国人说I shall not或I cannot时，反而暗示对not的轻微强调。

Actually, the word not is always pronounced full [not] and never [net], so that there is no way of pronouncing this not except either with a clear vowel or contracted as indicated.
实际上not始终发完整音[not]而非[net]，因此除了清晰元音或所示缩约形式外别无他法。

In questions especially, the forms Are you not coming? or Can he not go himself? are more rarely used than Aren't you coming? and Can't he go himself?
尤其在疑问句中，Are you not coming?或Can he not go himself?远比Aren't you coming?和Can't he go himself?少见。

Do ... not in questions is still rarer.
Do...not在疑问句中更为罕见。

One very rarely says Do you not think so? or Does he not come here everyday?, but uses forms with don't you and doesn't he.
人们极少说Do you not think so?或Does he not come here everyday?，而使用don't you和doesn't he的形式。

No student, therefore, can expect to speak English properly and idiomatically without mastering these forms (§ 3.51).
因此若不掌握这些形式，学生便无法期望说出地道规范的英语（§3.51）。

The use of don't for the third person singular present has never yet been countenanced by grammar books.
语法书从未认可don't用于第三人称单数现在时。

Actually, he don't is extremely common today, even in lectures by Columbia University professors, for instance.
但实际上he don't如今极为普遍，甚至在哥伦比亚大学教授的讲座中亦有所闻。

The underlying reason is the unconscious desire for economy, for doesn't consists of two syllables, while don't consists of only one.
深层原因是对经济性的无意识追求，因为doesn't含两个音节，而don't仅有一个音节。

That don't matter is certainly easier to pronounce than That doesn't matter.
“That don't matter”显然比“That doesn't matter”更易发音。

However, it is not for the Chinese students of English to be pioneers in English grammar reform.
但中国英语学习者不必充当英语语法改革的先驱。

### 16.41. 缩略词

Abbreviations have also become a part of the English daily language.
缩略词也已成为英语日常用语的一部分。

Ordinarily, one says auto and not automobile, taxi and not taxi-cab, co-ed and not co-education, movie and talkie and not moving picture and talking picture, 'phone instead of telephone, cinema instead of cinematograph, and exam instead of examination.
通常人们说auto而非automobile，说taxi而非taxi-cab，说co-ed而非co-education，说movie和talkie而非moving picture和talking picture，用'phone代替telephone，用cinema代替cinematograph，用exam代替examination。

An advertisement is referred to as an ad, and an omnibus is just a bus.
广告被称为ad，公共马车简称为bus。

The Elevated Railways in New York is progressively abbreviated thus: elevated—el.—L.
纽约高架铁路的缩写演进为：elev
