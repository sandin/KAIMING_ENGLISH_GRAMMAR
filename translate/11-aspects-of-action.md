## CHAPTER XI: ASPECTS OF ACTION
## 第十一章：动作的体貌

### 11.01. The Study of the Verb
### 11.01. 动词的研究

The study of the verb and its changes has been often regarded as the most important, and perhaps the most difficult, part of grammar.
对动词及其变化的研究常被视为语法中最重要的部分，或许也是最难的部分。

It is true that the verb is the most important word in any sentence, because it is the verb which gives life to the whole sentence and connects the parts up in a logical whole.
诚然，动词是任何句子中最重要的词，因为是动词赋予整个句子生命，并将各部分连接成一个合乎逻辑的整体。

Compare, for instance, *She is picking roses in the garden*, which gives us a satisfactory mental picture, with *She roses in the garden*, where the succession of images is dead and unrelated.
例如，比较 *She is picking roses in the garden*（她在花园里采玫瑰），这给了我们一个令人满意的心理画面，与 *She roses in the garden*（她玫瑰在花园里），后者中的意象序列是死板且无关联的。

Undoubtedly, also, the verb undergoes more changes and requires more careful handling than any other part of speech (compare, for instance, the relative stability of the noun).
无疑，动词也比任何其他词类经历更多变化，需要更仔细地处理（例如，比较名词的相对稳定性）。

Just as an action has more complicated relations than an object or a quality, so a verb is subject to more variations than a noun or an adjective.
正如一个动作比一个物体或一种性质有更复杂的关系一样，动词也比名词或形容词有更多的变化。

An action immediately presupposes some one who does it (the subject of the action), and it may easily affect some one else or some particular thing (the indirect or direct object).
一个动作立即预设了执行它的人（动作的主语），并且它可能轻易影响其他人或某个特定事物（间接或直接宾语）。

Then, an action always takes place in time, whereas an object or quality does not necessarily involve a time-notion.
此外，动作总是在时间中发生，而物体或性质则不一定涉及时间概念。

Finally, the action itself may be of the most various kinds, whether active or passive, continuous or completed, real or supposed, etc.
最后，动作本身可能是多种多样的，无论是主动还是被动，持续还是完成，真实还是假设，等等。

In usual grammar books, the verbs are divided into three classes, transitive, intransitive and auxiliary; each transitive verb may have two voices, active and passive; each voice may have so many moods, like interrogative, indicative, imperative and infinitive; the indicative and interrogative moods again may have so many tenses, present, past and future, and so many subordinate tenses, like present simple, present perfect, present perfect continuous, etc.
在通常的语法书中，动词被分为三类：及物动词、不及物动词和助动词；每个及物动词可能有两种语态：主动和被动；每种语态可能有多种语气，如疑问语气、陈述语气、祈使语气和不定式；陈述语气和疑问语气又可能有许多时态，如现在时、过去时和将来时，以及许多从属时态，如一般现在时、现在完成时、现在完成进行时等。

In this book, which is based on notional principles, the verb will be studied mainly under four heads: (a) the Aspects of Action (Chap. XI), (b) Transitive Action, especially the relationships of the subject and object (Chap. XII), (c) the Time of Action (Chap. XIII), and (d) the verbal moods, or Fact and Fancy (Chap. XIV).
在这本基于意念原则的书中，动词将主要在四个标题下进行研究：(a) 动作的体貌（第十一章），(b) 及物动作，特别是主语和宾语的关系（第十二章），(c) 动作的时间（第十三章），以及 (d) 动词的语气，或事实与假想（第十四章）。

Thus, except the relationships with subject and object, and the notions and expressions of time and mood, all the other changes will be covered under the term "Aspect."
因此，除了与主语和宾语的关系，以及时间和语气概念与表达之外，所有其他变化都将包含在"体貌"这一术语之下。

### 11.02. What is an Aspect?[^1]
### 11.02. 什么是体貌？[^1]

An "aspect" of action means a class of action.
动作的"体貌"意指动作的一个类别。

Actions, naturally, may be divided into different classes.
动作自然可以分为不同的类别。

Thus—
例如—

- repeat
- 重复
- reiterate
- 重申
- return
- 返回
- recover
- 恢复
- regain
- 重新获得

belong to one class of action, in so far as they have all one aspect in common, i.e., all the actions consist in doing something over again or in going back to some thing.
属于同一类动作，因为它们都有一个共同的体貌，即所有动作都包含再次做某事或回到某事物。

The same action or actions may be classified according to different aspects.
同一个或同一组动作可以根据不同的体貌进行分类。

If we take the word *repeat*, we may look at it from another aspect, and say that it is a transitive verb in having the action extended to some object, as *repeat a song*.
如果我们拿 *repeat* 这个词来说，我们可以从另一个体貌来看它，并说它是一个及物动词，因为动作延伸到了某个宾语，如 *repeat a song*（重复一首歌）。

In this aspect, *repeat* may be classified with other transitive verbs like *kill (a man), tell (a story), eat (some food)*, which are different from intransitive verbs like *go, come, rest, sleep*.
在这个体貌下，*repeat* 可以与其他及物动词如 *kill (a man)*（杀死一个人）、*tell (a story)*（讲一个故事）、*eat (some food)*（吃一些食物）归为一类，这些动词不同于不及物动词如 *go*（去）、*come*（来）、*rest*（休息）、*sleep*（睡觉）。

Thus the consideration whether an action is transitive or intransitive may be considered an aspect-notion.
因此，考虑一个动作是及物的还是不及物的，可以被认为是一种体貌概念。

Again, actions may be considered as of long duration (*know, remember, love*) or of short duration (*learn, remind, fall in love*).
再者，动作可以被认为是持续长久的（*know* 知道、*remember* 记得、*love* 爱）或持续短暂的（*learn* 学会、*remind* 提醒、*fall in love* 坠入爱河）。

Or an action may be active (*I tell a story*) or passive (*I am told*).
或者一个动作可以是主动的（*I tell a story* 我讲故事）或被动的（*I am told* 我被告诉）。

There is also a distinction between habitual action (*I smoke a pipe*) and simple present (*I am not smoking today*).
还有习惯性动作（*I smoke a pipe* 我抽烟斗）和一般现在时（*I am not smoking today* 我今天不抽烟）之间的区别。

Thus the same action and the same verb may belong to different "aspects" or classes.
因此，同一个动作和同一个动词可能属于不同的"体貌"或类别。

Some aspects are determined by the nature of the verb itself (transitive—intransitive), others may depend on how it is used (active—passive) or on tense-modifications (perfect—continuous).
有些体貌是由动词本身的性质决定的（及物—不及物），其他的可能取决于它的用法（主动—被动）或时态变化（完成—进行）。

In every language, certain aspects of action are clearly recognized.
在每种语言中，某些动作体貌都被明确地认识到。

Without making clear to oneself these aspect-notions, the proper use of the verb will never be really understood, in spite of the clearest conjugation tables.
如果不对这些体貌概念有清晰的认识，即使有最清晰的动词变位表，也无法真正理解动词的正确用法。

Take, for instance, the English distinction between *I wrote* and *I have written*.
例如，英语中 *I wrote* 和 *I have written* 的区别。

This is usually classified as a tense-distinction, but the important difference is not one of time, but of aspect.
这通常被归类为时态区别，但重要的区别不在于时间，而在于体貌。

Back of this formal distinction is the aspect-notion, whether an action is regarded in itself (*I wrote*) or with reference to its result (*I have written*).
这种形式区别背后是体貌概念，即一个动作是被视为动作本身（*I wrote* 我写了）还是参照其结果（*I have written* 我已经写了）。

The important thing is to realize the aspect-notion behind these formal changes.
重要的是要认识到这些形式变化背后的体貌概念。

### 11.03. The English Verbal Aspects
### 11.03. 英语动词的体貌

The important aspect-notions in English that should be carefully studied and fully understood are the following.
英语中应仔细研究和充分理解的重要体貌概念如下。

(1) The difference between action and condition.
(1) 动作与状态的区别。

(2) The difference between transitive and intransitive action.
(2) 及物动作与不及物动作的区别。

(3) The difference between active and passive aspects of action.
(3) 动作的主动体貌与被动体貌的区别。

(4) The difference between completed and uncompleted action.
(4) 完成动作与未完成动作的区别。

(5) The inceptive, continuative and cessative aspects, or the beginning, continuation and end of action.
(5) 起始体、持续体和终止体，或动作的开始、继续和结束。

(6) The difference between durative (long-time) and punctual (short-time) action.
(6) 持续（长时间）动作与瞬间（短时间）动作的区别。

(7) Habitual action.
(7) 习惯性动作。

(8) Tentative action.
(8) 尝试性动作。

(9) Miscellaneous minor aspects showing causative, reiterative, reflexive and reciprocal action.
(9) 各种次要体貌，表示使役、重复、反身和相互动作。

### 11.10. Action and Condition
### 11.10. 动作与状态

The first and most important distinction of aspect is the difference between action and condition.
体貌的第一个也是最重要的区别是动作与状态之间的区别。

It is true that *I am recovering (from illness)* is in the "present continuous tense" and *I have recovered* is in the "present perfect tense."
诚然，*I am recovering (from illness)*（我正在康复中）是"现在进行时"，而 *I have recovered*（我已经康复了）是"现在完成时"。

But it is not true that the difference between *I recover* or *recovered* on the one hand, and *am recovering* or *have recovered* on the other, is a difference of tense.
但另一方面，*I recover* 或 *recovered* 与 *am recovering* 或 *have recovered* 之间的区别并非时态的区别，这种说法是不正确的。

The real difference between the two is one of aspect, namely that while *recover(-ed)* denotes an action as such, *am recovering* and *have recovered* denote, not an action, but a condition.
两者之间的真正区别在于体貌，即 *recover(-ed)* 表示动作本身，而 *am recovering* 和 *have recovered* 表示的并非动作，而是一种状态。

Chinese students continuously confuse the two aspects, and employ the action-aspect far too often, where really the condition-aspect should be used.
中国学生常常混淆这两种体貌，并且过多地使用动作体貌，而实际上应该使用状态体貌。

Thus one often hears such remarks as *You play with fire*, which is highly un-English.
因此，人们常听到诸如 *You play with fire* 这样的说法，这是非常不地道的英语。

The idea is to indicate the condition that you are playing with fire.
其本意是指示"你正在玩火"这种状态。

Such mistakes are extremely common.
这类错误极为常见。

- He comes here. (Say *is coming*)
- 他来这里。（应该说 *is coming*）
- You make a great mistake. (Say *you are making, or have made*)
- 你犯了一个大错误。（应该说 *you are making, or have made*）
- He deceives you. (Say *he is deceiving, or has deceived*)
- 他欺骗你。（应该说 *he is deceiving, or has deceived*）
- I consider this question now. (This is an impossible sentence: say *I will consider or am considering*)
- 我现在考虑这个问题。（这是一个不可能的句子：应该说 *I will consider or am considering*）
- You fool me. (Say *you are fooling*)
- 你愚弄我。（应该说 *you are fooling*）
- The child plays alone in the room upstairs. (Say *is playing*)
- 孩子在楼上房间里独自玩耍。（应该说 *is playing*）
- I do not smoke this week. (Say *I am not smoking this week*)
- 我这周不抽烟。（应该说 *I am not smoking this week*）
- I do not see anybody today. (Say *I am not seeing*)
- 我今天不见任何人。（应该说 *I am not seeing*）
- I stay at the Y.P.S. Hotel. (Say *I am staying*)
- 我住在 Y.P.S. 旅馆。（应该说 *I am staying*）
- I must go. (Say *I must be going*)
- 我必须走了。（应该说 *I must be going*）
- He gets better now. (Say *he is getting*)
- 他现在好起来了。（应该说 *he is getting*）
- He suffers from a headache. (Say *he is suffering*)
- 他头痛。（应该说 *he is suffering*）

One may question why the fact that *I must be going* should be expressed as a condition and not as an action.
有人可能会问，为什么 *I must be going*（我必须走了）这个事实应该被表达为一种状态而不是一个动作。

But it is exactly this peculiarity in English ways of thinking that should be noted.
但这正是英语思维方式中应注意的特殊性。

To a very large extent, the present continuous has supplanted, or is supplanting, the present indefinite, whose use is being gradually limited.
在很大程度上，现在进行时已经取代或正在取代一般现在时，一般现在时的使用正逐渐受到限制。

The fact is, an action often covers a long period of time, so that the action becomes a condition, for which the continuous or the perfect is more suitable.
事实是，一个动作常常涵盖很长一段时间，以至于该动作变成了一种状态，对于这种状态，进行时或完成时更为合适。

Hence a sentence like *I stay at Y.P.S. Hotel* or *I do not see anybody today* (present indefinite) does not, in the English way of thinking, seem to accord with the truth.
因此，像 *I stay at Y.P.S. Hotel*（我住在 Y.P.S. 旅馆）或 *I do not see anybody today*（我今天不见任何人）（一般现在时）这样的句子，在英语思维方式中，似乎与事实不符。

The use of *I stay* and *I do not see* seems to indicate only an action lasting a short moment.
使用 *I stay* 和 *I do not see* 似乎只表示持续短暂瞬间的动作。

*I am staying* (pres. continuous) at that hotel not only at this moment, but also this morning and this evening.
*I am staying*（现在进行时）在那家旅馆不仅指此刻，也包括今天上午和今天晚上。

And if I do not wish to see any visitors today, *I am not seeing* (pres. continuous) them not only at this moment, but also in the morning and in the afternoon.
而如果我今天不想见任何访客，*I am not seeing*（现在进行时）他们不仅指此刻，也包括上午和下午。

The present indefinite is, therefore, used chiefly in three connexions.
因此，一般现在时主要用于三种情况。

First, to suggest habitual action: as *Do you play tennis? / He smokes*.
第一，表示习惯性动作：如 *Do you play tennis?*（你打网球吗？）/ *He smokes*（他抽烟）。

Secondly, in general statements: as *The earth moves / The moon waxes and wanes / The results depend on your own effort / The balloon goes up by its own weight or lightness / It pays to advertise / As soon as the vessel is filled, it topples over*.
第二，用于一般性陈述：如 *The earth moves*（地球转动）/ *The moon waxes and wanes*（月亮盈亏）/ *The results depend on your own effort*（结果取决于你自己的努力）/ *The balloon goes up by its own weight or lightness*（气球因其自身重量或轻浮而上升）/ *It pays to advertise*（做广告是值得的）/ *As soon as the vessel is filled, it topples over*（容器一满就翻倒）。

In all these examples, really no present action is indicated.
在所有这些例子中，实际上并未表示当前的动作。

Thirdly, where the verb itself is sufficient to indicate a long duration.
第三，动词本身足以表示长时间持续的情况。

Many verbs are of this nature: *know, feel, realize, think, understand, fear, hate, love, like, live, be, remain*, etc.
许多动词具有这种性质：*know*（知道）、*feel*（感觉）、*realize*（意识到）、*think*（认为）、*understand*（理解）、*fear*（害怕）、*hate*（憎恨）、*love*（爱）、*like*（喜欢）、*live*（居住）、*be*（是）、*remain*（保持）等。

E.g., *He knows (feels, sees, realizes) his mistake / I think you ought to go / I understand what you mean / I fear you are wrong / I hate to go alone / He intends to come back / You forget that you owe him a debt of gratitude / Where do you live? / That is a mistake / That remains to be proved*.
例如：*He knows (feels, sees, realizes) his mistake*（他知道/感觉到/看到/意识到他的错误）/ *I think you ought to go*（我认为你应该去）/ *I understand what you mean*（我明白你的意思）/ *I fear you are wrong*（我担心你错了）/ *I hate to go alone*（我讨厌独自去）/ *He intends to come back*（他打算回来）/ *You forget
