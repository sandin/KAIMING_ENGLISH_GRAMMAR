## 第十五章：关系

### 15.10. 连词与逻辑关系

The conjunctions in any language serve to bind the various parts of a sentence together.
任何语言中的连词都用于将句子的各个部分连接在一起。

Grammatically speaking, they are the joints of the sentence structure.
从语法上讲，它们是句子结构的关节。

Notionally speaking, their function is to express the logical relationships.
从概念上讲，它们的功能是表达逻辑关系。

This latter view is broader and more comprehensive.
后一种观点更广泛、更全面。

We see, for instance, that English sentences often begin with conjj. like “and,” “therefore,” “but,” or “because”: “And I went away” / “Therefore I went away” / “But how can I do it?” / “(Why didn’t you go?) Because it was too late.”
例如，我们看到英语句子常以“and”、“therefore”、“but”或“because”等连词开头：“And I went away” / “Therefore I went away” / “But how can I do it?” / “(Why didn’t you go?) Because it was too late.”

It would be easy to find their logical relationship with the preceding sentence, whereas it would not be so easy to establish their grammatical relationship with the same, because every sentence is supposed to be a separate unity.
找出它们与前一句的逻辑关系很容易，而要确定它们与前一句的语法关系则不那么容易，因为每个句子都被假定为一个独立的整体。

### 15.20. 简单句、并列句与复合句

The parts of a simple sentence may all be classified as shown in the following scheme:—
简单句的组成部分可全部按以下方案分类：—

- Predicate
- 谓语
  - (1) Subject | (2) Principal Vb. \ (3) Object
  - (1) 主语 | (2) 主要动词 \ (3) 宾语
  - (4) and (5) Modifiers which may be attached to any of the three parts above (and sometimes to one another)
  - (4) 和 (5) 修饰语，可附加于上述三个部分中的任何一个（有时也相互附加）
    - Conjunctions
    - 连词
    - Adjectives
    - 形容词
    - Adverbs
    - 副词
    - Nouns & Verbs (rarely), see §9.27.
    - 名词和动词（罕见），见 §9.27。
    - Nouns in apposition, §8.40
    - 同位名词，§8.40
    - Participles
    - 分词
    - Pronominal phrases (adj. or adv. phr.)
    - 代词短语（形容词性或副词性短语）
    - Infinitive phrases (adj. or adv. phr.)
    - 不定式短语（形容词性或副词性短语）
    - Participial phrases (adj. phr.)
    - 分词短语（形容词性短语）

The above accounts for the structure of simple sentences.
以上说明了简单句的结构。

Interjections or exclamations are practically independent in their nature.
感叹词或惊叹语本质上是独立的。

In such simple sentences, conjj. are chiefly used to join modifiers: “I saw a good and handsome boy” / “He worked hard and fast.”
在这类简单句中，连词主要用于连接修饰语：“I saw a good and handsome boy” / “He worked hard and fast.”

The subject and principal vb. remain simple in nature.
主语和主要动词本质上保持简单。

Then we have another kind of sentence where we have either two subjects to one vb. (He and I went), or two vbb. to one subject (He came and went).
然后我们有另一种句子，其中要么是一个动词带两个主语（He and I went），要么是一个主语带两个动词（He came and went）。

Some grammars consider these already as compound sentences in contracted forms (=He came and he went / He went and I went contracted).
有些语法书认为这些已经是缩略形式的并列句（=He came and he went / He went and I went 的缩略）。

But this has no practical meaning except for grammarians who are in the habit of classifying things.
但这除了对习惯于分类的语法学家外，并无实际意义。

Thirdly, we have real compound sentences, like the following:—
第三，我们有真正的并列句，如下所示：—

- He went away, so I came.
- 他走了，所以我来了。
- I came, because he went away.
- 我来了，因为他走了。
- Either you said so, or you didn’t.
- 要么你这样说了，要么你没有。
- You broke it, therefore you must pay for it.
- 你打碎了它，因此你必须赔偿。
- He wanted to go, but he didn’t.
- 他想去，但没有去。

It is seen in the above that the conjj. so, because, etc. serve to connect two separate sentences into one, each part having its own subject and predicate.
从上面可以看出，连词 so、because 等用于将两个独立的句子连接成一个，每个部分都有自己的主语和谓语。

So far, no clause has been introduced that is woven into another clause.
到目前为止，还没有引入被编织进另一个从句的从句。

He went away is clearly separate from I came.
He went away 与 I came 显然是分开的。

The moment we introduce a clause which is woven into another, or serves as part of its structure, we have what is called a complex sentence.
当我们引入一个被编织进另一个从句，或作为其结构一部分的从句时，我们就有了所谓的复合句。

For example—
例如—

- I didn’t say this. (Simple)
- 我没说这个。（简单句）
- I didn’t say that I wouldn’t go. (Complex: that I wouldn’t go serves as object in the main clause.)
- 我没说我不去。（复合句：that I wouldn't go 在主句中作宾语。）
- That is unknown to me. (Simple)
- 那事我不知道。（简单句）
- How he did it is unknown to me. (Complex: noun clause as subject.)
- 他是怎么做的，我不知道。（复合句：名词性从句作主语。）
- The man went away. (Simple)
- 那个人走了。（简单句）
- The man who was with you went away. (Complex: relative clause as modifier of man.)
- 和你在一起的那个人走了。（复合句：关系从句修饰 man。）

In the above three examples of complex sentences, we have the conjj. that, how and the relative pron. who serving to connect the new clause with the original main clause.
在上面三个复合句的例子中，我们有连词 that、how 和关系代词 who 用于将新从句与原来的主句连接起来。

A relative pron. is really only a conjunctive pron., just as a relative adv. (the time when, the place where) is only a conjunctive adv., because its function is to connect the new clause with something else, besides serving its regular function inside the relative clause.
关系代词实际上只是一个连接性代词，正如关系副词（the time when, the place where）只是一个连接性副词，因为它的功能除了在关系从句内发挥其常规作用外，还将新从句与其他东西连接起来。

### 15.30. 并列从句与从属从句

In the complex sentences, it is clear that there is always one main or principal clause, and one or more subordinate or dependent clauses.
在复合句中，显然总是有一个主句或主要从句，以及一个或多个从属或依赖从句。

The dependent clause is woven into, or dependent upon, the main clause, and is therefore rightly regarded as of lower rank.
依赖从句被编织进主句或依赖于主句，因此被正确地视为较低等级。

Thus in The man who was with you went away, the clause who was with you is dependent on the main clause The man went away.
因此在 The man who was with you went away 中，从句 who was with you 依赖于主句 The man went away。

But even in some compound sentences, we can distinguish between main and dependent clauses.
但即使在一些并列句中，我们也能区分主句和从属从句。

In He came, but I went, both clauses are evidently of equal importance, and there is no main or dependent clause.
在 He came, but I went 中，两个从句显然同等重要，没有主句或从属从句。

But in He would come, if I would go, clearly the first clause (He would come) is the main statement, and if I would go describes only a condition of his coming.
但在 He would come, if I would go 中，显然第一个从句（He would come）是主要陈述，而 if I would go 仅描述了他来的一个条件。

The second clause is therefore felt to be of less importance or lower rank than the first.
因此，第二个从句被认为不如第一个从句重要或等级较低。

Thus we can have a main clause and a dependent clause even in a compound sentence.
因此，即使在并列句中，我们也可以有主句和从属从句。

In such compound sentences, just what clause is considered main or dependent, and whether the two clauses are of equal or unequal importance depends entirely on the meaning.
在这类并列句中，究竟哪个从句被认为是主要的或从属的，以及两个从句是同等重要还是不同等重要，完全取决于意义。

It cannot be judged from the grammatical form.
不能从语法形式来判断。

Conj. like and, both, either . . . or, but, as well as, not only . . . but also naturally introduce co-ordinate clauses (of equal rank).
像 and、both、either . . . or、but、as well as、not only . . . but also 这样的连词自然引出并列从句（同等地位）。

On the other hand, conj. like if, because, although, since, in order that, so that, lest naturally introduce subordinate clauses (of lower rank).
另一方面，像 if、because、although、since、in order that、so that、lest 这样的连词自然引出从属从句（较低地位）。

Following are some illustrations of the difference between co-ordinate and subordinate clauses, as determined by their meaning (words in italics are conj. or conjugative phrases):—
以下是一些说明并列从句和从属从句区别的例子，这是由其意义决定的（斜体词为连词或连接性短语）：—

**CO-ORDINATE CLAUSES (equal rank)**
**并列从句（同等地位）**

- He was a thief, *and* she was the thief’s wife.
- 他是个小偷，*而*她是小偷的妻子。
- This one is good, *but* that one is not.

- You must do as I say; *otherwise* (or: *or else*) I will have nothing to do with you.
- 你必须按我说的做；*否则*我将与你无关。

**SUBORDINATE AND MAIN CLAUSES (unequal rank)**
**从属从句与主句（不同等地位）**

- I will tell you, *if* you will promise not to tell any one.

- *So long as* you persist, I will not give you any money.
- *只要*你坚持，我就不会给你任何钱。

### 15.40. 逻辑关系

All conj. express some kind of logical relationship.
所有连词都表达某种逻辑关系。

These relationships may be classified roughly under the following heads, under each of which, we shall examine the means of expressing them in English.
这些关系大致可分为以下几类，在每一类下，我们将考察英语中表达它们的方式。

The conjj. play the most important role, together with the conjunctive parts (relative pronn. and relative advv.).
连词与连接部分（关系代词和关系副词）起着最重要的作用。

Prepositional and participial phrases are often employed instead of clauses introduced by conjj.; in fact, they are always shorter and therefore make the sentences simpler and easier to handle.
介词短语和分词短语常被用来代替由连词引导的从句；事实上，它们总是更短，因此使句子更简单、更容易处理。

### 15.41. 结合

The commonest form of relationship is combination.
最常见的关系形式是结合。

And and both . . . and may connect any kinds of words or groups of words.
And 和 both . . . and 可以连接任何种类的词或词组。

- He was [both] defeated and tired (combining adjj.).
- 他[既]被打败了又很累（连接形容词）。
- He played [both] fast and beautifully (advv.).
- 他演奏得[既]快又优美（副词）。
- We saw each other off and on (advv.).
- 我们断断续续地见面（副词）。
- The arrow pierced into and through his chest (prepp.).
- 箭射入并穿透了他的胸膛（介词）。
- I paid both for him and [for] his friends (prepp.).

- He was strong and he was handsome (clauses).
- 他很强壮，而且他很英俊（从句）。
- Men must work and women must weep (clauses).
- 男人必须工作，女人必须哭泣（从句）。

Other similar relationships are expressed by as well as, not only . . . but (also), furthermore, besides, in addition, what is more, on top of that:—
其他类似的关系由 as well as、not only . . . but (also)、furthermore、besides、in addition、what is more、on top of that 表达：—

- He, as well as his secretary, was found guilty.
- 他，以及他的秘书，被认定有罪。
- We not only dined together, but also danced together.
- 我们不仅一起吃了饭，还一起跳了舞。
- Not only did we dine together, but we also danced together.

- On top of that, they were denied all intercourse with their friends.
- 除此之外，他们还被剥夺了与朋友的一切往来。

### 15.42. 对立

Probably the most useful conj. for expressing opposition is the word however.
可能表达对立最有用的连词是 however 这个词。

Other words and phrases are: but, while, whereas, far from, on the contrary, on the other hand, despite (prep.), in spite of (prep.) and the simpler prepp. contrary to and against.
其他词和短语有：but、while、whereas、far from、on the contrary、on the other hand、despite（介词）、in spite of（介词）以及更简单的介词 contrary to 和 against。

While but is the simplest and commonest in use, however is most useful both as a variation from but and as a conj. which could be placed in different parts of a sentence, thus making for a smoother and more flexible construction.
虽然 but 是最简单和最常用的，但 however 作为 but 的变体以及作为一个可以放在句子不同部分的连词最为有用，从而使结构更流畅、更灵活。

Nevertheless is also very useful, conveying a deeper sense of contrast, while notwithstanding (prep.) is a little archaic.
Nevertheless 也很有用，传达更深层次的对比感，而 notwithstanding（介词）有点过时。

- However, I am merely reporting this as a fact.
- 然而，我只是将此作为一个事实来报告。
- This, however, is something different from what you said the other day.
- 然而，这与你前几天说的有些不同。

- （用于表达让步。——无论我多么想帮助你，我都不能。见 § 15.45。）
- But you said you could.
- 但你说过你能。
- While this position offers you honour and power, it imposes on you also a great responsibility.
