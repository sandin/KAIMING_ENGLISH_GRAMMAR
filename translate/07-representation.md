## 第七章：指代

### 7.10. 指代

When we say "John speaks to John's mother, but John's mother does not hear John," everybody feels that the statement is unnecessarily long and awkward.
当我们说"约翰对约翰的母亲说话，但约翰的母亲听不见约翰"时，每个人都觉得这个陈述不必要地冗长和笨拙。

Usually we say "John speaks to his mother, but she does not hear him."
通常我们说"约翰对他的母亲说话，但她听不见他。"

The words his, she and him represent, or take the place of, John's, John's mother and John.
词语 his、she 和 him 代表或取代了 John's、John's mother 和 John。

Hence it is often said that pronn. are words which take the place of nn.
因此，人们常说代词是取代名词的词。

This is quite true, but it should be remembered that, like all other definitions, this definition should not be taken too seriously.
这很正确，但应记住，像所有其他定义一样，这个定义不应过于拘泥。

The word mother in John's mother can be said to take the place of, or represent, Mrs. X, and yet it is not considered a pron., but a n.
John's mother 中的 mother 一词可以说是取代或代表了 X 夫人，但它并不被认为是代词，而是名词。

What is more important for the student of grammar to remember is that here we are dealing with a general problem of representation.
对于语法学习者来说，更重要的是要记住，我们这里处理的是一个普遍的指代问题。

We use she to represent Mrs. X, because there is a need for economy in speech.
我们用 she 来代表 X 夫人，是因为言语中需要简洁。

There are various reasons for using representation: for economy, variation, expressiveness, and for social reasons.
使用指代有各种原因：为了简洁、避免重复、表达生动以及出于社会原因。

But this is not confined to pronn.
但这并不仅限于代词。

When we say "He forgot to take the cover off, although I told him to" (for "to take the cover off"), we are purposely avoiding repetition and aiming at economy just as in using the pron. she for Mrs. X.
当我们说"他忘了把盖子拿掉，虽然我告诉过他（要拿掉盖子）"时，我们是有意避免重复并力求简洁，就像用代词 she 代替 X 夫人一样。

On the other hand, when we purposely avoid saying "I believe" and use "we believe" or "the present writer believes" instead, we do not achieve economy, but are satisfying a need for modesty.
另一方面，当我们有意避免说"I believe"而使用"we believe"或"the present writer believes"时，我们并非为了简洁，而是为了满足谦逊的需要。

When a Chinese mother refers to her husband not by mentioning his name, but as "So-and-so's father" or as the very ambiguous "he," she is also using a form of representation out of shyness.
当一位中国母亲提到她的丈夫时，不直接说他的名字，而是说"某某的父亲"或非常含糊的"他"，她也是出于羞怯在使用一种指代形式。

Finally, when a newspaper editor writes "A certain general is reported to have sent a large consignment of a certain commodity to Shanghai," instead of writing more bluntly "General Y— has sent a consignment of opium," he is using representation to avoid going into gaol.
最后，当报纸编辑写道"据报道，某位将军已将一大批某种商品运往上海"，而不是更直白地写"Y将军运送了一批鸦片"时，他是在使用指代以避免入狱。

The pronn. are, of course, the most important class of words used for representation.
当然，代词是用于指代的最重要的一类词。

In this chapter, we shall study not only the forms of pronn. but also the purposes for which representation is used.
在本章中，我们不仅要学习代词的形式，还要学习使用指代的目的。

We shall also study various means of representation besides the pronn., such as the use of metaphors, indirect statements and representation by omission.
我们还将学习除代词之外的各种指代手段，例如隐喻的使用、间接陈述和省略指代。

### 人称代词

### 7.20. 人称代词：格和人称

When we speak of pronn., we always think of the words I, you, he, she, it, we, they.
当我们谈到代词时，我们总是想到 I, you, he, she, it, we, they 这些词。

These are called "personal pronouns" and they form the most important class.
这些被称为"人称代词"，它们构成了最重要的一类。

There are also impersonal and other pronn. which we shall study later.
还有非人称代词和其他代词，我们将在后面学习。

All these personal pronn. except it, refer to persons, and the words who may also be included here.
除了 it 之外，所有这些代词都指代人，who 这个词也可以归入此类。

These pronn. are said to belong to three persons and three cases.
据说这些代词属于三个人称和三个格。

In the following tables, the old or archaic forms are put in brackets.
在下表中，旧的或古体的形式放在括号内。

|          | 单数       | 复数 |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| 第一人称 | I            | we     |
| 第二人称 | you (thou)   | you    |
| 第三人称 | he, she, it  | they   |

The words I, you, he, etc. used as subjects of vbb. are said to be in the "nominative case";
用作动词主语的 I, you, he 等词被称为处于"主格"；

the words my, your, his, etc. are said to be in the "possessive case";
my, your, his 等词被称为处于"所有格"；

and the words me, you, him, etc. used as objects of vbb. (see me) or of prepp. (for me) are said to be in the "objective case."
而用作动词宾语（见 me）或介词宾语（for me）的 me, you, him 等词被称为处于"宾格"。

| 主格 | I      | (thou) | he   | she  | it   | we   | you  | they | who  |
|------------|--------|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| 所有格 | my     | (thy)  | his  | her  | its  | our  | your | their| whose|
| 宾格  | me     | (thee) | him  | her  | it   | us   | you  | them | whom |

The peculiar thing about the pronn. in the objective case is that they are usually unaccented and are joined to the preceding vbb. or prepp. in pronunciation as if they were syllables of the same word.
宾格代词的一个特点是它们通常不重读，并且在发音上与前面的动词或介词连读，就好像是同一个词的音节一样。

Thus—
因此—

Don't believe it [biˈliːvɪt].
Don't tell them [ˈtelðəm, ˈteləm].
I can't see him [ˈsiːhɪm, ˈsiːɪm, ˈsiːm].
Was glad to meet her [ˈmiː tə] (pr. just like meter).
No use denying it [diˈnaɪiŋɪt].
in it [ˈinit], above it [əˈbavɪt].
once upon a time [ˈwʌnsəpɒnəˈtaɪm].
at home [ætˈhəʊm, or: əˈtəʊm], at it [ætit, or: əˈtɪt].
to him [ˈtuː(ː)ɪm], to me [ˈtuːmiː].
for us [ˈfɔːrəs, ˈfɔːrəs; or: ˈfɔːr-].

Chinese students usually say "tell them," "see him"— which is all wrong.
中国学生通常说"tell them"、"see him"——这完全是错误的。

Only when these words are emphasized do we accept them, as "for me, not for you."
只有当这些词被强调时我们才接受它们，如"for me, not for you"。

### 7.21. Mine, Thine, 等

Study the following:—
学习以下内容：—

This is my book.                          It is mine.
This is her ring.                         The ring is hers.
You bring your book.                      They will bring theirs.
It is my pleasure.                        The pleasure is mine.
It is your fault.                         The fault is yours.

Notice when the nn. used after my, thy, etc. are understood, we change the pronn. into mine, thine, etc.
注意，当 my, thy 等后面使用的名词被省略时，我们将代词改为 mine, thine 等。

Thus we have the following series, with the exception of its.
因此我们得到以下系列，除了 its。

my—mine                                  our—ours
thy—thine                                your—yours
his—his                                  their—theirs
her—hers                                 whose—whose

A very peculiar use is seen in the following:—
在以下例子中可以看到一个非常特殊的用法：—

Our friend.                               A friend of ours.
My pen.                                   This pen of mine.
Their relative.                           A relative of theirs.
Jimmy's (his) brother.                    A brother of Jimmy's (his).
Your boy-husband.                         That boy-husband of yours.
Your filial son.                          That filial son of yours.
Her uncle's book.                         That book of her uncle's.

There is always a tinge of familiarity implied in such expressions.
这类表达总是隐含着一丝亲昵的意味。

Notice that we cannot say that your son or this my pen, but must say that son of yours or this pen of mine (cf. § 8.30).
注意，我们不能说 that your son 或 this my pen，而必须说 that son of yours 或 this pen of mine（参见 § 8.30）。

Exercise 45. Put in the words mine, thine, etc. and omit the nn. wherever you can in the following sentences 1-5, and use a ... of yours, that ... of mine, etc. in the sentences 6-10.
练习 45. 在句子 1-5 中填入 mine, thine 等词，并在可能的地方省略名词；在句子 6-10 中使用 a ... of yours, that ... of mine 等结构。

1. I will give you my book, and you will give me your book.
2. My mother is older than her mother.
3. He forgot to bring his dictionary. I have not forgot my dictionary.
4. It is both your fault and his fault.
5. Here is a handkerchief. Whose handkerchief is it?
6. That son you have is up for mischief.
7. He is my father's darling friend.
8. That is his pet notion.
9. That is one of my bad habits.
10. It has been my fond dream to visit Europe.

### 7.22. 谦逊、尊敬、亲昵等的影响

As we have said already, pronn. are used for different purposes of representation.
正如我们已经说过的，代词因不同的指代目的而被使用。

Pronn. are changed also, therefore, when the purpose is changed.
因此，当目的改变时，代词也会改变。

Out of modesty, real or assumed, we often try to avoid using too many "I's," especially in writing, and substitute for them the vaguer "we," as in we believe, we have often seen, if we are to believe his words, if we are not mistaken.
出于真实或假装的谦逊，我们常常尽量避免使用太多的"I"，尤其是在写作中，并用更模糊的"we"来替代，如 we believe, we have often seen, if we are to believe his words, if we are not mistaken。

This is so especially in writing.
在写作中尤其如此。

Sometimes the present writer is used instead, as in It has come to the present writer's knowledge, etc. for "my knowledge."
有时使用 the present writer 来代替，如 It has come to the present writer's knowledge 等，代替"my knowledge"。

In official signed statements, the undersigned (sing. or pl.) is often used with vbb in the third person (The undersigned is, or are, of the opinion, etc.).
在官方签署的声明中，the undersigned（单数或复数）常与第三人称动词连用（The undersigned is, or are, of the opinion 等）。

Compare Chinese 鄙人, 愚, 愚見, etc. instead of 我, 吾意.
比较中文中用 鄙人、愚、愚見 等代替 我、吾意。

This, of course, is always formal and may seem at times affected and unnatural.
当然，这总是正式的，有时可能显得做作和不自然。

Compare also the "modest" use of one (§ 7.24, "c").
另比较 one 的"谦逊"用法（§ 7.24, "c"）。

On the other hand, respect or deference to a superior or stranger often compels us to avoid the direct "you."
另一方面，对上级或陌生人的尊重或敬意常常迫使我们避免使用直接的"you"。

Compare Chinese 楊先生, 煥章先生, 尊意 and the Pekingnese 您 instead of 你, 汝意.
比较中文中的 楊先生、煥章先生、尊意 以及北京话的 您 代替 你、汝意。

The English you can be used in addressing superiors and strangers quite generally, where Chinese would avoid it by saying "Mr. Yang," 'Miss Chen" (楊先生, 陳女士, 煥章先生), etc.
英语的 you 在称呼上级和陌生人时相当普遍可以使用，而在中文中则会通过说"杨先生"、"陈女士"、"焕章先生"等来避免。

Study also the following expressions:—
也学习以下表达：—

I object, your Honour (to judge).
Your Majesty (to king, queen, emperor). Also in the third person His Majesty the King, Her Majesty the Queen, Their Majesties the King & Queen, whence H. B. M. (His or Her Britannic Majesty), H. M. S. (His Majesty's ship).
Your (His, Her) Royal Highness (to princes, etc.).
Your Excellency (to ambassadors, governors & their wives).
Hence "the late H. E. Wu Ting-fang." It is His Excellency's desire, etc.
Received an order from yourself, or your good self (only in commercial letters).

Familiarity, on the other hand, causes us to use the plain, natural "I" and the blunt "you," and it is good for a man to be able to speak and write naturally.
另一方面，亲昵使我们使用平实、自然的"I"和直率的"you"，一个人能够自然地说和写是很好的。

In the "familiar style" of essays and in personal letters, we write as if we are speaking to intimate friends in our unbuttoned moods, and this way of writing has a charm of its own.
在随笔的"亲昵体"和私人信件中，我们写作时就像在轻松的心情下与亲密的朋友交谈，这种写作方式有其独特的魅力。

That is also why the humorists usually use the plain I and you (I believe, I met, I know, I doubt, I can't understand, you know jolly well, you will never understand, not if you die in the attempt, etc.)
这也是为什么幽默作家通常使用平实的 I 和 you（I believe, I met, I know, I doubt, I can't understand, you know jolly well, you will never understand, not if you die in the attempt 等）。

Then there are various other factors, social or psychological.
此外还有各种其他因素，社会的或心理的。

A modern Chinese young lady sometimes refers to her father as "papa" even when speaking to people not her relatives, perhaps out of a desire to appear dainty.
一位现代中国年轻女士有时甚至在对非亲属的人说话时也称她的父亲为"papa"，也许是出于想显得娇俏的愿望。

In all households with children, the terms "mother," "mammy," "daddy," "uncle," "auntie" invariably supplant other ways of reference, so that the husband would often refer to his wife as "mother" (How is mother? / Where's daddy?).
在所有有孩子的家庭中，"mother"、"mammy"、"daddy"、"uncle"、"auntie"这些称呼总是取代其他指代方式，以至于丈夫常常称他的妻子为"mother"（How is mother? / Where's daddy?）。

Study also the following:—
也学习以下内容：—

Damn it, kid, I love you! (among sweethearts)
But, my dear sir, this is not so simple (sarcastic, familiar). Also, in the same sense: my good sir, my dear fellow, my good man, my good woman (cf. 老兄啊!).
How is my baby? (to sweethearts and wives)
Don't let the old man know (referring to father or husband).
What does your old man (woman) say? (husband or wife)
But yours truly will not be there (slang for I).
What can a fellow do? (for What can I do?)
Ask my Mrs. She knows all about it. How is your Mrs.? (common familiar term for wife)

It is quite all right in English to speak of "my wife," "my husband" as a common term of reference.
在英语中，用"my wife"、"my husband"作为常见的指称是完全合适的。

Special mention should be made of the royal we and the editorial we.
应特别提及的是 the royal we（君王自称的我们）和 the editorial we（社论我们）。

The first is used by kings and queens in proclamations and official statements ("It has our approval," "We feel better today").
前者用于国王和女王在公告和官方声明中（"It has our approval," "We feel better today"）。

The second is used by the newspaper editor in his leaders ("We do not think it fit to publish the said letters").
后者用于报纸编辑在其社论中（"We do not think it fit to publish the said letters"）。

In both cases it is based on the idea of collective responsibility.
在这两种情况下，它都基于集体责任的概念。

### 7.23. 反身代词和相互代词

Besides the regular pronn., there are the self-pronn. in English:—
除了常规代词，英语中还有 self-代词：—

myself ………………ourselves
thyself ………………yourself, yourselves
himself }
herself } ………………themselves
itself
